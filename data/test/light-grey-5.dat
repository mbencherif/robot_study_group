A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Then we can put it in.	B-D
A: Oh wait I have an idea.	B-A
K: Stop, stop stop.	B-OO
A: You can go there because (?).	B-D
G: It won’t fit. That’s why I had this on the (axle).	I-D
A: Yeah	B-OO
A: These stupid chords are so much in the way. Or do we want to put it on the bottom?	B-D
G: I like it here.	I-D
K: Okay try it.	B-OO
G: It's (?).	I-OO
A: There we go.	I-OO
G: (?) like peekaboo.	B-D
K: It looks like wall-e now. No it has to be Eve, fine it's wall-e.	B-OO
A: Okay it's plugged in.	I-OO
T: How do you get them to...	O
A: Do you want me to just gonna program it.	B-QS
K: So she’s gonna add in some things.	I-QS
G: So it's on here like this right?	B-A
A: Okay we’ll make a thing, so...	B-D
G: That’s exactly a point but this needs to be...	B-A
MA: I'm just gonna take this board a minute and bring it right back, is that gonna distract you?	O
G: No, no no. Here so that’s the corner of each.	B-A
A: Okay. So that’s our.	I-A
G: Okay. So can you move out the way please?	B-OO
A: Actually it will need to move over (?).	B-A
K: Okay it's working, it's kind of, oh gosh.	B-NSTO
A: No it's working.	I-NSTO
K: It didn’t kill the animals. Yes.	B-OO
G: Well the cow (moved if you look at it).	I-OO
50:00 DBS: Yeah roughly.	O
G: So it backed up here, so then if we have it turn slightly, we have it like turn, it was like this when it backed up, because it hit the truck. So I think...	B-DO
A: Th- this truck is in the way. Yeah we should.	I-DO
G: Lets try this again but lets move it over slightly. More.	B-A
A: So	B-OO
G: Okay? Here we go.	I-OO
K: We moved the fish.	B-DO
A: No you didn’t.	I-DO
K: Oh	B-OO
A: Yeah, no, you know. Try out this (?).	B-NSTO
G: What if we try and go for the yellow one first?	B-A
K: Yeah what is, if that, that might work.	B-OO
G: Angle it differently like this.	B-A
A: Go ahea-	B-OO
G: Lets try this. Oh...	I-OO
MA: That (?) be there. Ta da. Do I get points for that?	O
G: So I'm just gonna put everything backwards then.	B-ATO
A: So we have something.	B-OO
G: If we’re gonna do that instead so I have to make this one...	B-ATO
A: Also we got to do lighting, got to fix that, because that’s a big one.	B-A
G: Where is lighting? Display, sound, what’s this one?	B-QS
A: (?) status light.	I-QS
K: I'm trying to program.	B-OO
A: (?)	I-OO
G: What color?	B-QS
K: We should do it purple.	I-QS
G: Lets do it green.	I-QS
A: Green.	I-QS
K: No I want it purple.	I-QS
A: Er true.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: What colors are there?	B-QS
A: Lets try it.	B-OO
T: What are you guys doing?	O
K: We’re doing the.	B-OO
A: Here plug this in, give me the robot thingy to measure.	B-A
G: Yeah yeah. And then that one’s gonna be right now, so like this one...	B-ATO
K: Here I can, I can try it come on.	B-OO
G: It's gonna back up.	B-ATO
K: No we have (?).	B-OO
G: So the light will go on and it will go forward it’ll come backward and turn right, it’ll go forward and come backwards.	B-ATO
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
G: So that’s good.	I-OO
G: Do you want it to be a full right turn or do we want to have a slightly u-turn? U-turn or right?	B-ATO
A: Right there.	I-ATO
G: Here, okay so...	B-OO
K: Can I go and get like get something like (?).	I-OO
T: (Can you what)	O
K: Can I go and get like a little break?	B-OO
T: Yeah what do you want to do (?) out there (?)	O
K: No I just wanna sit down for a second.	B-OO
T: Okay you can sit down out there.	O
K: Okay. (?)	B-OO
A: Try it again, wait is it at A? (Brick) status, light. Oh hold on.	B-QS
G: Wait a minute, go back into here for a sec.	I-QS
A: Oh I forgot it was touch screen.	I-QS
G: So then...what does A attach to? That.	B-QR
A: Oh sugar.	B-OO
G: You’re gonna have to reattach.	B-QR
A: Okay I’ll do that. Feel so sorry for whoever’s been listening to me for this past hour.  You must have a wonderful job.	B-OO
G: I'm sorry that you had to listen to us complain about how it's not working.	I-OO
A: Yes, yes.	I-OO
G: Terribly sorry.	I-OO

A: Lets try yellow, yellow.	B-ATV
G: No still red. ‘cause it's on two. Still red, still red.	I-ATV
A: Yellow. It's close enough, here I’ll attach it, I got it.	I-ATV
G: Okay you attach that, oh wait got it.	B-D
A: Okay we got (?).	B-OO
G: One minute, can you move your hand for a second?	I-OO
A: Yeah I just gotta... (move) some stuff.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
A: Let’s do this. Program...	I-OO
G: Oh no. What just happened?	I-OO

A: Um	B-OO
YTS: Okay where’s your (?).	O
T: You guys would you prefer that I call your parents or do you guys want to call your parents and let them know it's gonna be five fifteen at the school instead of four forty five .	O

K: Wait, wait, wait guys, guys...	I-OO
A: ...here.	I-OO
G: Wait	I-OO
A: (?) my finger.	I-OO
G: Forwards backwards, no we need a right but... We need it almost a u-turn. Not three sixty but like a u-turn so then it’ll turn around.	B-ATO
A: Forward we want that to be more left right?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Yeah I got it. So do... Three.	B-ATV
G: Not like that, like that,	B-ATO
A: There. Erm.	B-OO
G: And then we need this one forward again, right?	B-ATO
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: And then we need another one for backwards.	B-ATO
G: Oh yeah. It it, is it plugged in?	B-QR
A: How do you download?	B-QS
G: Is it plugged in?	B-QR
A: Yeah. How do you download?	B-QS
G: (?).	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
K: Okay let’s try this.	I-OO
G: Hey guys there’s another station over there (?).	I-OO
K: Yeah let’s go.	I-OO
G: Something looks different.	I-OO
K: No it's not.	I-OO
G: It looks different though.	I-OO
K: It kind of does but not really, it's not different.	I-OO
A: It, it... hhhh	I-OO
G: That one’s a bit darker.	I-OO
A: I saw that. Oh, oh, oh, oh no fine...okay, no we don’t want that forward.	B-DO
G: We need it backwards all the way.	I-DO
A: Where did that other piece of corn go?	B-OO
G: Need backwards and then we need it to turn. Excuse me.	B-DO
A: Yeah okay.	B-OO
G: (?).	I-OO
M: This is partly a camera reset and it's partly me remembering what I was gonna tell you. I told some teams separately but I want to tell you altogether, when you’re writing a program and it has a bunch of different missions in it, what happens if your program gets hung up, your robot gets hung up on that first mission? (?) rest of the mission, so try to write a separate program for each mission that you’re doing, maybe you can put two in there if it seems like it's gonna be a (?).	I-OO
K: (When can I do what we can do)	I-OO
M: (?)	O
K: We can do it	B-OO
M: Is everybody set to go, okay, back to work.	O
A: Lets do this. Everything’s reset I think. Go.	B-OO
G: Go, go, go, noooo. Okay so lets see your problem.	B-NSTO
A: Well did you fix it?	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Oh god.	I-OO
K: Why oh my gosh.	I-OO
G: Oops.	I-OO
A: huh huh	I-OO
G: Oops. Okay then.	I-OO
A: (?) broke it.	I-OO
G: I didn’t break it, you broke it here.	I-OO
A: This lego came out. Put the corn thingy bob...	I-OO
MT: (?).	O
G: What?	B-OO
MT: Do you mind if you I (record this	O
G: Not at all it's probably gonna fail anyway. Exactly.	B-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha	I-OO
G: That didn’t work correctly.	B-NSTO
K: Okay that was very distructive.	I-NSTO
FT: Did you guys already go out in front of the judges?	O
G: Not yet.	B-OO
K: Oh no.	I-OO
FT: Okay we’ll try and (?).	O
K: That’s really cool that, like (?) cell phone have like slow motion	B-OO
G: My ipad has um	I-OO
MT: You’re gonna see it blow up in slow motion, it's very slow.	O
K: That’s fine.	B-OO
MT: Here it comes.	O
K: That’s so weird.	B-OO
MT: Boom.	O
K: Hmm, maybe we can focus on the angle a bit more.	B-A
G: Yeah no I just angled it wrong. Oh angled that wrong too.	I-A
K: Oh my god.	B-NSTO
G: Oh god.	I-NSTO
MT: <laughing>	O
K: Eve is evil.	B-OO
MT: (Call it a twister)	O
K: No her name is Eve you know from Wally, the one who blows up everything.	B-OO
G: Oh no, (they changed this yellow car)	I-OO
K: We killed a lot of things.	I-OO
G: Oh my gosh	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh.	I-OO
K: The cow, you know that cow died.	I-OO
G: (?) not get hurt, but oh my gosh this thing isn’t broken. You have to put it on the Velcro.  Okay lets try this again.	I-OO
K: Here try Eve right like...	B-A
G: There.	B-OO
K: Eve is evil, oh my gosh, the cow’s head fell off, no.	I-OO
G: It did	I-OO
A: So two and a half and five and a half.	B-A
G: No...	B-OO
K: Did you see what, what that looked like.	I-OO
G: It looked like motion sickness.	I-OO
T: Andi (?) told your mum	O
A: Um I d-	B-OO
G: I texted my cousin.	I-OO
A: Probably working right now.	I-OO
T: I set it for five fifteen?	O
A: Yeah he’s probably working right now, so.	B-OO
G: (Georgie) you do know your name tag’s upside down.	I-OO
G <laughing>	O
T: Do you want that? Did you do that on purpose or...	O
G: I don’t know.	B-OO
T: Okay um so, your mum’s coming here at three thirty five?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
T: Okay, so initially I thought we ended at four but we end at four thirty, so I left a message for her just letting her know that we’ll be here.	O
A: (Not working) okay, stop.	B-NSTO
K: This is how the cow looks like now.	B-OO
G: That worked great until the end, I think I’ll program that better.	B-NSTO
A: So we should do that, just fix the end.	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Do you remember what angle you had?	B-A
G: Nope.	B-OO
A: Oh my god we’re gonna die, just fix the end and we’ll figure it out. Wait you forgot to download, oh...	B-A
G: There we go.	B-OO
: (?).	O
G: (?) you did a cow.	B-OO
A: Oh it's...	I-OO
G: Oh my god it's... (?) it's fixed it. We kind of broke it.	I-OO
K: It's how it is now.	I-OO
G: What did you do to the cow?	I-OO
K: It, it's how it is.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
G: (?), I got it.	B-OO
A: Oh, oh it's beautiful huh?	I-OO
DGS: To me it turned too much.	O
DGP: Yeah.	O
DGA: Yeah.	O
A: Oh my god you idiot.	B-OO
K: It's not my fault that it decided to not, not listen to me.	I-OO
DGS: Lets turn this one off. So we need to go in.	O
DGP: So how much gonna go (?).	O
DGS: Okay, I think we need to go up to here right and then if you just move it like that and (?). It wont move that much.	O
DG: (?).	O
<general classroom noise>	O
G:  (?) just make it so that it swerves all over the table destroying everything	B-A
K: Wait wait wait don’t do it yet. I’m going g- video	B-OO
G: It's close enough really. To tell you the truth I feel bad for this car right now. Well...we’re still...oh here’s the blue one. So lets try this again.	I-OO
T: Oh where did this come from?	O
K: Oh we broke it.	B-OO
G: (?).	O
A: Another thing.	B-OO
