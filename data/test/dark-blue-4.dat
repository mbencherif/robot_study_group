F: Was it like here?	B-A
L: I think so.	I-A
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Think we’re ready.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
F: Oh, you just started in the wrong place.	B-A
L: Yeah I started at the wrong spot.	I-A
F: Oh, whoops.	B-OO
S: Fiona.	I-OO
L: Fiona you just do that when we do it.	I-OO
F: Oh the robot totally did that. Thanks.	I-OO
S: So we’re almost ready to plan route two after this?	B-A
L: Well if it works.	B-OO
F: So it needs to be like this.	B-A
L: Yeah. Yep.	B-OO
F: Yay.	I-OO
L: Perfect well it needs to go a little bit further actually.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: But almost perfect.	B-DO
S: No but it's on the base.	I-DO
L: Well none of it can stick out.	I-DO
F: Alright I'm gonna change this one to two point five.	B-ATV
L: Actually Fiona I realise it's fine cos it doesn’t have to completely be on.	B-DO
F: I think it needs to be, doesn’t it need to be completely in the base rest to do stuff to it though? We should actually get two point five to be safe.	B-ATV
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: It, it shouldn’t be too hard, okay.	I-OO
L: Well let me attach.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Attachment.	B-D
F: Okay, starting a new one.	B-OO
L: Wait let me get that changed (?) you just made. Do you think it works?	B-QS
F: Alright, do you want to save it?	I-QS
L: No	B-OO
F: I think it should work.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah do you have the program for the next one?	I-OO
S: Yes I do.	I-OO
L: Okay, why dont you (?).	I-OO
F: As long as we get into the base.	B-A
S: Okay this is confusing because I used another one, so this is how we do it.  So instead of facing...	I-A
F: It might actually, oh sorry...Sarah I can interrupt for a second, if we’re going to, which one are we getting at to the green ones?	I-A
S: No the outside ones.	I-A
F: Okay, well we’re going to go back to the base, so it might be a slightly different path than what you have charted out but we could go for the green one...	I-A
S: Yeah, no I have...	B-OO
F: ...we got a plough to move the fish.	B-D
S: ...no I have a way to go back to the base, just the map intersects with each other.	B-A
F: Okay, cool.	B-OO
S: Okay so instead of exiting (?) you exit from here, you go this way, you go around the obstacle so you cant approach that one over there	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: From right up front.	B-A
S: You go like this, you circle one round, you hit this one first and you keep going around then you hit this one and I was thinking that you sort of go all the way round but apparently not and then you go back...	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: ...and you go this way but if you want to you can also get that third route in (?) You go this way and you go right round to base.	B-A
F: Okay, cool, so lets start it, lets start with move tank probably.	B-ATO
S: Hmm.	B-OO
F: So then it goes forward you know	B-ATO
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: And we want it to be facing, well do you want it facing forward or backwards this time? Forwards would be okay.	B-ATO
S: It wouldn’t matter you would just need to go (?).  So either way I guess.	I-ATO
F: Alright, erm, so how far do we need it to go, lets look at the actual table and estimate how far it is, do you want to do that Sarah?	B-A
S: Okay.	B-OO
S: Alright.	I-OO
L: Can I do the programing this time?	I-OO
F: Yeah go ahead.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: That’s fine.	I-OO
L: Just I’ll wait for you to... What is that?	I-OO
F: (I think all...)	I-OO
S: It's a kitty and a pig.	I-OO
F: I think all of us should at least get a chance to do like the programing stuff.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Because that’s like the coolest part about it, alright so Sarah lets stop drawing pigs and get to the business.	I-OO
S: Okay, excuse me that pig is a scientifical miracle.	I-OO
F: Okay, alright, so we get back...	B-A
S: Okay. Okay we start it from here.	I-A
F: Yes.	B-OO
S: And it's route would take it, wait let me look at my map.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Okay, so...	I-OO
F: So it needs to go here, here right...	B-A
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: ...it goes here and then here.	B-A
S: And then it goes this way, that way around that way.	I-A
M: Alright I have a few little announcements, the first one is that every team is gonna go and meet with some judges.	O
It's okay, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter you don’t have to be ready, nobody’s ready.  Most engineers aren’t ready.	O
L: Three months right.	B-OO
M: They’re not gonna, they’re not gonna look at your programs they’re just gonna ask you some questions about whether or not you’re enjoying today, how it's going, what you’re liking about it, so each team is gonna go out for about eight minutes, you’re all gonna be gone for the	O
40:00 same amount of time so it doesn’t impact judges, but some are gonna go early and some are gonna go later.  So it's just the girls, not the grown ups, the grown ups can stay in here, go outside, take a break whatever.  The judges will ask you to turn your microphone off while you’re talking to them and then you can put it back on when you come in here.  And I will be taking teams out to the judges.  The second thing is trying to remember all the things I had, the second thing is I've had a couple of questions about coming into base.  If any part of your robot is in base as it's coming back you can grab it, it doesn’t have to come back all the way into base, so even just a little bit touching the black line or above the black line you’re good.  Another thing when you’re saving your programs please give them names that make sense.  We’re seeing a lot of programs called program, program one program two and that’s not gonna help you when you have one minute at the table this afternoon, because you’re gonna have to try to find it and if they’re all called program you’re not gonna know which one does the fish or does the (?).  Can’t remember what the other things were.	O
F: The Banbury Cheese.	B-OO
M: (?), okay, well there was one other thing I want to tell you about, but I don’t know what it was now, so I’ll let you know when I figure it out, so get back to work and I’ll start pulling teams in about five minutes for judges.	O
L: Okay guys did you (?).	B-OO
F: We need, we need to save the different things as...	B-QS
S: Okay do you want me to finish walking you through my plan?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
S: Okay so...	I-OO
F: (?).	I-OO
S: (?) I want to look at it.	I-OO
S: Okay, so you start from here, you go to about here, you might not (?) that’s fine, you go to about here and you go that way and stop at (sink or about sink).  You go that way and you plough through the edge of that.	B-A
F: Okay. And then you go around it, oh yeah we’re not doing (?).	I-A
S: Then you loop round here, go through and then you head back.	I-A
F: We’re just talking (?) stuff.	B-OO
S: As pretty much a straight (ball) and then a diagonal curve.	B-A
LGS: Oh no you killed the pig.	O
(?) we killed a animal.	O
F: Murder.	B-OO
<laughing>.	O
F: Alright I think we...Alright lets try and do it in little steps, lets try to figure out the distance that we need to go.	B-ATV
S: What does it do if (?)...okay, how about, how far does it go for one?	I-ATV
F: Alright, lets actually have it hit the blue ball because then we get extra points for that.	B-A
L: Hmm. What?	B-OO
F: That’s cool. We should have it go (?)=	B-A
L: Oh just waiting for (?).	B-OO
F: =straight this far let’s figure out how much it needs to go to be about that far.	B-A
S: So how far would it go for one?	B-ATV
F: I'm not sure, lets figure out you know that length, lets figure out how many revolutions we need it to do to do that.	I-ATV
S: Wait put it on the table, I want to see what one revolution is.	I-ATV
F: Alright, yeah you’ve got it.	B-OO
L: Okay, why don’t...	I-OO
F: Alright we’re doing we’re gonna try to figure out what the revolutions are, are you alright?	B-ATV
L: Yeah, can you just, figure out if that is like good enough so it all saves so I can delete this and start the new one.	B-QS
F: I think it's saved, I think that, oh wait, lets just save it one more time just to make sure.	I-QS
L: Well I want to make that has everything, was that everything that there is?	B-OO
F: Yeah I think so, lets, how do we save the, how do we save the new name for the thing?	B-QS
L: Do you want just like check it on the	B-OO
T: How do you do what?	O
F: So it's not pro...how do we save it so it's not named program?	B-QS
T: I think you just click on it, click on the program.	O
F: Maybe.  Oh okay, lets name it step one maybe or something like that, oh it's not typing it.  I think you need to, it's a PC so you need to use these (?).	B-QS
L: Yeah, I am.	B-OO
F: You need to double click maybe.	B-QS
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: Okay, there it goes, we already have the thing named as Banbury Cheese so maybe we should name it like...okay Banbury step one, okay.	B-QS
L: Okay, fine, alright Banbury step one.	B-OO
F: I don’t know will that show up on it?	B-QS
T: That’s a good question.	O
F: Lets just save it and it’ll rename it probably.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah Banbury step... Well lets just call it step one.	B-QS
T: Oh just call it Banbury one because they might be putting all the programs on the same robot, so you want to know it's yours.	O
L: What?	B-OO
F: Banbury one, okay yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
T: You know what I mean they might download all the programs onto one robot.	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: I'm not sure.	O
L: Okay, lets make a new one then, okay I'm going to unplug	B-OO
F: Yes. Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay are we ready to delete this stuff?	I-OO
F: Yeah, or we can make a new one, if you do like a plus thing that might make a new, new program.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah and now lets...alright so we just want to make it go, we just need to figure out what the certain distance forward should be, it's basically going to be all right angle turns so it shouldn’t be too hard.	B-ATO
L: So...	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Well there’s one turn which isn’t a right angle it's a diagonal but it should be easier, you just need to get it partially on base then we’re good.	B-ATO
L: What? No	B-OO
F: No, no, no, no...	I-OO
L: How do I get this to not delete?	B-QS
F: If you, and then...	I-QS
L: Yeah (?). Yeah okay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Righteo.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: What do we start with?	B-ATO
F: Alright so we’re gonna start with tank probably.	I-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: And then we need to just figure out how many revolutions it needs to make to go forward a certain distance.	B-ATV
S: But...first we need to know how...	B-A
F: It's just about this much.	B-ATV
S: ...how far it goes forward.	B-A
F: One revolution, so we should just do some testing for	B-ATV
L: Okay	B-OO
F: What the revolution is, so.	B-ATV
L: What do you want to start three?	I-ATV
F: One.	I-ATV
S: Just start with one row.	I-ATV
F: Start with one.	I-ATV
L: What, (?) eleven.	I-ATV
F: Eleven, lets play it.	I-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Wait I need that napkin.	I-OO
F: Oh, why is it, oh that’s, right, okay.	I-OO
S: Wait I need a napkin, put it on the table because it isn’t gonna go off.	I-OO
F: Okay, do you want to do it again just so we can...	I-OO
L: Sure.	I-OO
S: Okay, put it on the table.	I-OO
F: Yeah I'm ready. We probably need two of those, or two and a half?	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Okay, does that look good?	B-DO
S: Lets see.	B-OO
L: Do you want it further guys?	B-DO
F: Erm, I think that should be good.	I-DO
L: Okay, what next?	B-OO
F: We can like (?)	I-OO
S: You turn left.	B-ATO
F: ...yeah so we want it to be turning to the left at like ninety degrees.	B-ATV
L: Which is large motor (?).	B-QS
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: What are you going for now?	O
F: We’re going for the two at the back to knock those over, so we’re gonna make like a bunch of just like (?)...turns to get there.	B-A
L: Okay B or C?	B-ATV
F: I think that it's, let me see...	I-ATV
L: You wanna turn which direction?	I-ATV
F: B so...I think it would be B.	I-ATV
L: Hmm okay.	B-OO
F: And I think it was like one point three five that made it like a good turn.	B-ATV
L: Okay, well let’s save that one.	B-OO
F: Yeah, sure.	I-OO
F: Oh we want to go the other way, so it should be C.	B-ATV
L: C.	I-ATV
S: Okay C but same amount of turn.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: What next?	I-OO
F: Let’s just do it, just to see what (?).	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
M: You’re the first one’s up, get it out the way (?).	O
F: Maybe it should be one point two five, I don’t know.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright let me reset it.	I-OO
L: Want to say that?	I-OO
F: Yeah, yeah, yeah that’s good.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright and then that’s gonna take us, we’re going to need to go about, we’re gonna need to go this far, oh oops, oh yeah, okay so we’re going, so we’re gonna want to do move tank I think.	B-A
L: Okay, what?	B-OO
F: And I think it's going to probably just be one.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just to start with, but...lets see what it looks like.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah do you wanna be in charge of watching the robot and making sure that’s going the right distance?	I-OO
F: I don’t know maybe like one and a half.	B-ATV
L: Because it's also really helpful if you’re someone’s on the floor, so Fiona can be in the chair and you can be on the floor.	B-OO
S: Okay. Wait pass me the map please?	I-OO
L: Okay are you ready?	I-OO
50:00 F: Mm no I'm not. Alright. I think that’s kind of.	B-NSTO
S: Hmm let me see, so it's turning right from about here to here, so... So it starts there then be... Yeah roughly.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay, what do you do next?	I-OO
F: Erm...	I-OO
L: A turn.	B-ATO
F: Yes we want another one point two five turn probably, might want to test it out in C also.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I’ll add this, what portB or C?	I-ATV
F: We want it to turn, okay it's going that way, so we want it to be turning right.	B-ATO
L: You want B.	B-ATV
F: So it's B.	I-ATV
L: And you said one point	I-ATV
F: two five I think.	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: That’s like the (?).	I-OO
L: Okay. Right okay I’m gonna save it	B-QS
F: Alright. Sarah you want to watch.	B-OO
L: Wait can I...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: This is saved right?	B-QS
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay lets test out Banbury Two, ready to test it out Sarah?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Oh. yeah.	I-OO
F: Shall we, okay.	I-OO
L: Okay. Where are you guys starting?	B-A
F: I think we’re starting like here.	I-A
L: Yeah like that?	I-A
F: But like probably there, yeah.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright so it’s Banbury two. Yeah.	I-OO
S: Okay we want it to go a bit farther this way though.	B-DO
F: Yeah we want it to go a little further so we can maybe knock off a blue ball or (?).	I-DO
S: Yeah, just.	B-OO
L: Okay, righto.	I-OO
S: All yours.	I-OO
F: Well I think that it's, which one, I think that it's um  step three after (?).	B-ATO
S: No think it's step...	I-ATO
F: Step one?	I-ATO
S: Yeah one.	I-ATO
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah so we should maybe make it two point seven five.	B-ATV
L: You want it to be three	I-ATV
F: Maybe.	B-OO
L: because it actually didn’t go that far.	B-DO
F: Yeah I think it should be three yeah.	B-ATV
L: Okay, alright what do you want next? Forward right?	B-ATO
F: Want it to go, where did it end up?	B-DO
L: It was like facing forward, Fiona I think it needs to go forward now.	B-ATO
F: Yeah I think it needs to go forward, but we’re going to need to make it go, Lyn we’re gonna need to make it go forward and then turn and then go forward.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So...there’s a couple more steps.	B-ATO
L: Yeah, well how far do you think it should be like three again? Probably.	B-ATV
F: I don’t know we’re not, we don’t wanna, I think it should actually be like one because we’re not trying to get it all the way to the back or further at that point, we’re trying to get it a little bit past the trailer and then turn again and then go to the back.	I-ATV
L: Okay, how about one point five.	I-ATV
F: Yeah sure.	B-OO
L: Or two five.	B-ATV
F: Yeah sure.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Then you need to turn again.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: C (?)	B-ATV
F: Yeah think so...wait... Yes C.	I-ATV
L: Okay. How far?	I-ATV
F: One point two five I guess, because that’s the	I-ATV
L: No don’t want (?) five. Okay.	I-ATV
F: Okay	B-OO
L: And then.	I-OO
F: Do you wanna save it and try it out?	I-OO
L: Hold on I think I want to go, lets like finish up with the forward.	B-ATO
F: Yeah, er	B-OO
L: Where you say one point two?	B-ATV
F: Er oh we need to figure out how much...	I-ATV
L: Already did that one.	B-OO
F: ...oh wait.	I-OO
L: How do you I connect this to this?	B-QS
F: Maybe it needs to, click on the orange thing, there might be like a connector (?) control.	I-QS
L: This one.	I-QS
F: And then, I don’t know I don’t think so delete that one maybe.	I-QS
L: Sarah are you okay?	B-OO
