S: Huh?	B-OO
L: Are you okay?	I-OO
F: (?) how those things are? That sensor.	B-A
L: Okay. It happens (?) down there.	B-QS
L: Okay I'm just gonna move it, all down.	I-QS
Y: How’s it going?	O
F: Good.	B-OO
T: Effortless. On my part	O
Y: Well they’re doing all the work.	O
T: They are.	O
F: It should be effortless.	B-OO
S: Sarah.	I-OO
Y: Sarah, and you guys where you live?	O
L: Vermont.	B-OO
Y: Where in Vermont?	O
F: Oh they live in Marlborough and I live in Guilford.	B-OO
Y: Are you all at the same school?	O
F: Um We were at the same school for a while, I lived in, I used to live in Marlborough but I go to the school called (?) School which is in (?).	B-OO
S: She ran away from our weirdness.	I-OO
F: Yeah I ran away from them.	I-OO
S: And our terrible PE teacher.	I-OO
Y: So are you a teacher (?)?	O
T: I am a teacher I'm also (?).	B-OO
Y: Are you at their school?	O
T: I am at their school.	O
Y: Yes.	O
T: I used to teach her.	O
Y: How did you find out about?	O
T: A friend of ours is in the (?) Technology and program at Marlborough (?) school do you know that program and somehow she was sent information about it	O
L: Okay, I'm gonna save this.	B-QS
Y: What’s her name?	O
T: Rebecca Briscoe	O
Y: (?).	O
L: I'm gonna save it okay.	B-QS
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: Sarah are you ready?	I-OO
F: Sarah.	I-OO
S: Yeah coming.	I-OO
F: Okay. Alright lets do it. Banbury Two.	I-OO
L: Okay, you guys ready?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Hmm, hmm.	I-OO
F: Oh it got knocked off by a fish, yeah.	B-DO
S: Okay so little less because,	I-DO
L: okay what happens if we start from somewhere else then?	B-A
S: Yeah it’s gotta start right at the edge.	I-A
L: Right at the edge, so we’ll go for.	I-A
F: Yeah that’s not gonna work.	B-NSTO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: How hard is that (?)?	B-A
F: It's running over the fish.	B-DO
S: Oh okay.	B-OO
F: So do we need to make it turn more or not hit the fish?	B-DO
L: Hold on.	B-OO
F: No but that’s, returns are gonna be messed up.	B-DO
L: Oh yeah. Yay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Also I think that we wanted to hit the...	B-A
F: That.	B-OO
L: Alright	I-OO
M: Are you Banbury Cheeses?	O
L: Yes.	B-OO
M: You’re gonna be the next team to come out for judging.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
M: So you’re gonna break, not quite yet, I gotta bring the other team back in but you’re gonna turn off your microphones and you’re gonna bring your robot and any attachments that you have.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: I think we’re going to have to make it go not so far.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: I think it was okay before we don’t need to (?).	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: I mean I, I don’t think it's even that important.	I-OO
S: Don’t put it down to what it was before because otherwise it wont go far enough, but your...	B-A
F: I don’t think the most important part is like, oh sorry, is...like getting as many points it's just like getting the hang of the programing thing. (?)	B-OO
L: Two point five?	B-ATV
F: Yeah, that’s what it was before right? Or it was two	I-ATV
L: I think it was two. I shall save. Okay	I-ATV
F: Yeah	B-OO
L: Lets test it.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Okay, its hitting the truck. That’s actually, lets try it again.	B-DO
L: And it's also hitting over here.	I-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: I don’t know why that’s there.	I-OO
F: It only did that because it hit the truck I think, lets just try it again and see what’s happening.	B-DO
L: It's off the base.	B-A
F: Right.	B-OO
M: Bring your robot	O
<Microphones turned off whilst with judges>	O
09:20 S: Okay, so	O
F: we need to change distances.	B-ATV
L: Yes.	B-OO
S: (Where’s my map is this my map?) Okay.	I-OO
F: I think we already changed some, yeah we already try it out (?).	I-OO
S: Okay. Okay so knock this right here there’s no reason to freak out lets (it’s safe it’s sound an-)	I-OO
T: The map is still there.	O
S: Yes the most important thing ever, (is that) the robot.	B-OO
F: Okay. Alright we need it to not...	B-DO
S: Easy turn to the left.	B-ATO
F: ...we can use wow.	B-NSTO
S: What’s it doing? What’s it doing?	I-NSTO
10:00 F: It's getting skewed by stuff, erm maybe we could put,   maybe we could try some stuff with sensors so that when	B-DO
it feels stuff	O
L: I don’t know maybe we should...	B-A
S: I don’t think we should cos it will take too long.	I-A
L: Yeah let’s just keep (?).	B-OO
F: Alright let’s see er, maybe we can make it turn a little bit later but not too late.	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Let’s see it again, I wanna see what it does.	I-OO
L: Let’s get the turn a little bit shorter cause it could,	B-ATO
S: I want a small, I think you should make a smaller turn because it's tipping towards it slightly.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Smaller turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And the shorter turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Shorter distance, okay. Okay.	B-ATO
S: Where did my chair go? I think they took my chair.	B-OO
L: Yeah Mama please can Sarah have your chair?	I-OO
F: Oh I think that that table has one	I-OO
S: No I think she took my chair, I think one of you took my chair. They’re not listening.	I-OO
T: Get that one over there there’s one (?).	O
L: Alright okay	B-OO
S: Can I take this chair. We’re one short on our table.	I-OO
F: So which turn was that that was messing it up? (The first turn?)	B-ATO
L: The first turn.	I-ATO
F: Alright lets make it...	B-ATV
L: So... One.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Maybe.	I-OO
L: Okay and then a distant and then it has to go short distance so...	B-ATO
F: One point	B-ATV
L: Two five?	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Whoops.	I-OO
F: Wait, was it the first distance it was throwing it off or the second distance?	B-ATO
S: The second.	I-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Well yeah.	I-OO
S: I think it was the turning in the distance because it was slightly too far and... (?)	B-ATO
F: Alright lets try it with this.	B-OO
L: Yeah, okay wait, okay.	I-OO
S: Which table could we go to? Sorry. Maybe you should carry the map for a special bonus.	I-OO
L: Maybe it has the (?).	I-OO
F: (?) I think this thing is the sensor thing, could be (?) on with that.	B-A
S: Yeah  it’s like (?) (clothes dispenser) it’s like a tissue dispenser, make it bigger and it could be like a tissue driver  it drives tissues up the staircase for you.	I-A
F: You guys wanna try...	B-OO
L: Do we really need it?	I-OO
S: Just leave the map	I-OO
F: I don’t know, it think it would be cool but, whatever.	B-A
She’s not giving us the answers she’s just...	O
T: Just thought it would be cool.	B-OO
S: We don’t have time to hook up sensors.	B-A
F: No we have time.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: (?).	I-OO
L: Okay it needs to go further and not (?).	B-DO
S: Okay further this way and more that way after that.	I-DO
L: I think see that it goes like this and then it kind of turns that way more.	I-DO
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: So the turn needs to be more straight and then it needs to go forward.	B-ATO
F: Lets try it again and see,	B-OO
L: Do you want to watch it (?).	I-OO
L: One of the right angles (?).	B-ATO
F: Sure yeah	B-OO
L: Alright can we get a pen Sarah? So we can write on the other side of your tissue (?).	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: (?) a pen.	I-OO
S: Hold the tissue map (?).	I-OO
F: I don’t	I-OO
L: Why?	I-OO
L: (?) two hands?	I-OO
F: huh huh huh	I-OO
S: No, I lost one in a war, it was a war for a brownie it was epic.	I-OO
L: Oh okay	I-OO
F: Who were you fighting?	I-OO
S: I don’t know actually.	I-OO
L: Are you going to write?	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: I think (?) The whipped cream is flying everywhere.	I-OO
F: Okay, alright.	I-OO
L: Yeah that has to turn...	B-DO
F: So it's the second turn.	I-DO
L: ...and that needs to go.	I-DO
F: Alright so the second turn is what we need to change.	I-DO
S: No fair their’s got eye balls.	B-OO
L: Okay, second turn and I think a little bit of a shorter (?).	B-ATO
S: Are these sensors	B-A
F: On?	B-OO
L: On after the second turn	B-ATO
F: Okay	B-OO
S: Are these sensors?	B-A
L: Yeah I don’t think so. Okay.	B-OO
F: I can sense that on my face Sarah	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
<laughs>	O
L: Second turn...is there like a second turn?	B-ATO
F: Um	B-OO
L: Wait it goes (?).	B-ATO
F: Yeah that’s the second turn.	I-ATO
L: So shorter second turn.	I-ATO
F: I don’t know.	B-OO
L: So one...	B-ATV
S: Can plug things into these ones, this is I think is some sort of (?) sensor.	B-A
F: Should be one, one.	B-ATV
S: Camera pluggy thing.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: I'm gonna video tape something now.	I-OO
L: Okay, now we’re just doing like (?).	B-A
F: Yeah. But that’s cool it works better that way probably. Because then we’re not estimating.	I-A
S2: Go ahead	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: I just hope it works this way.	I-OO
F: Wait, lets line it up with the sides so we actually know where it is.	B-A
L: Here?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah still needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Oh we need it to go further.	I-DO
S: Farther that way	I-DO
L: Farther farther yeah	I-DO
F: Before it makes that third turn.	B-ATO
L: No this, yeah...	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: No but the fish... We run over the fish.	B-A
L: Well we were trying but then the fish (?)	I-A
T: What if you put something long on the end?	O
F: But the fish...	B-A
L: The fish.	B-OO
F: The fish. The fish	B-A
T: It could stick.	O
H: (?) right?	B-OO
F: What?	I-OO
H: As long as you don’t move the baby fish it doesn’t matter.	O
T: Yeah you can move the fish.	O
S: No it isn’t the moving the fish that’s the matter it's the hitting the fish itself.	B-A
H: (?)	O
F: It runs over the fish and  kinda s’cuse it yeah.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Alright so we need to make the thing after the second turn or the third turn?	B-ATO
L: Second turn.	I-ATO
T: (?) if you just stick a little stick on there (?).	O
L: Oh wait that was...	B-OO
T: It might be an extra two points that’s all.	O
L: I'm sorry (?) don’t want walking all the way over there.	B-OO
F: I think it would be cool to just try to get this done first and then if we have some extra time to do it, yeah.	I-OO
T: It's candy.	O
F: It’s candy	B-OO
L: Okay, lets say two?	B-ATV
F: Two yeah.	I-ATV
T: Bonus for (?).	O
F: ha ha ha (?) check, destroy everything.	B-OO
S: Okay, evil genius list I’ll start writing.	I-OO
L: Lets hope this works now.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah you can keep on writing. Fiona and I shall...	I-OO
S: I'm writing an evil genius (?) completely doing nothing.	I-OO
L: Okay if that’s what you wanna do I guess. (?) to go.	I-OO
S: It's slightly off but I don’t think (not enough to) matter.	B-DO
F: Ah	B-OO
L: Okay that needs to be...	B-DO
F: It needs to go a little further.	I-DO
S: Tiny bit, you’re almost there.	I-DO
F: Oh okay.	B-OO
S: We’re almost there anyway, almost.	B-DO
L: A little bit farther.	I-DO
F: I wanna just (?).	B-OO
S: Look, Lyn look evil genius list.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Waha	I-OO
L: What’s shorter than one point two five? Besides one.	B-ATV
F: Wait I think we need to make it longer. Oh, oh the turn? Er one point one.	I-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: And we need to make one of the turns a little bit...	B-ATO
L: Yeah I did that.	B-OO
F: One of the distances. Okay (?).	B-ATV
<General classroom noise>	O
L: Okay back. (I always forget) (?)go immediately.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: That distance just needs to be a little longer. Yeah we got it there.	B-DO
L: This one a little longer and then we add the (?). Because it goes waaa.	I-DO
T: It's gonna be a little bit of a tricky turn.	O
L: Yeah, well...	B-OO
F: We can have it go diagonal and then diagonal and then straighten itself out, but I (?).	B-A
L: Okay so the last turn is a little longer right?	B-ATO
F: Yeah should be like two.	B-ATV
L: So two point five?...wait I mean not two point five, two, one, one point...	I-ATV
F: Wait, was it the turn or the distance, oh that’s the, oh that’s moving it.	B-ATO
L: Distance was good the turn I think was a little short because...	I-ATO
F: No I think it, the distance should be longer when it goes.	I-ATO
L: Yeah, yeah that’s right, sorry (?) so one point five do you think?	B-ATV
F: Um lets make it two,	I-ATV
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Lets make it two.	B-ATV
L: Okay. Right, now...	B-OO
F: And then maybe we can scale it down to one point seven five, I don’t know how to connect them, maybe, (?) we could ask someone how we connect the things together.	B-ATV
L: Okay, maybe mom will know, shall we ask?	B-OO
F: Lets just try doing it and see if it strings them together.	B-QS
L: Okay, so...	B-OO
F: It would be a turn.	B-ATO
L: ...okay which way?	I-ATO
F: Um it goes that way it’ll need to be turning to the right so that would B or C? that would be C.	B-ATV
L: (?) add another play, maybe that will help, so B you said?	B-QS
F: C? wait, which one turns it to the right?	B-ATV
20:00 L: Um	B-OO
F: It's, okay I wanna see which one...	I-OO
L: I think it's B.	B-ATV
F: Because B is connected to this one which is on, I think it's C ac-, wait, that one’s C and that one turns to the left, so it's B I think yeah, sorry.	I-ATV
L: Okay it's B and then we go forward, like two?	I-ATV
S: Look at my evil (?)	B-OO
F: Yeah lets make it go two, Sarah do you want something to do?	B-ATV
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: Okay why don’t you help answer the questions (?) okay? Lets see if that works.	I-OO
S: Look at my evil list.	I-OO
<laughs>	O
L: Your (older sister) is three (?).	B-OO
F: (?) brownie mix.	I-OO
S: Hee hee hee hee	I-OO
L: Oh my god. Okay.	I-OO
F: You downloaded alright?	B-QS
S: See this is what boredom does to one.	B-OO
F: Why are you bored Sarah? You should be (?)	I-OO
S: Because you guys are (programing I’ve got nothing to do)	I-OO
L: You can help answering the question.	I-OO
F: Why is it going forward?	B-DO
L: What?	B-NSTO
S: Why didn’t it turn?	B-DO
L: Oh okay so I guess its connecting doesn’t work like that, we need help really.	I-DO
F: Yeah lets, lets just ask somebody.	B-OO
S: Don’t know how to connect what?	B-QS
F: Lets show you what we’re talking about Sarah. Er	B-OO
L: Alright. Sarah?	I-OO
S: I'm fixing the fish, don’t judge me.	I-OO
F: Okay so look at the computer in your swivel chair of evil, so we need to be able to connect that to that, oh maybe we...	B-QS
T: Can you just slide it over it?	O
L: No I already did that.	B-QS
F: It doesn’t, maybe if we, if we get rid of the...	I-QS
L: It doesn’t.	I-QS
F: Yeah I know...	B-OO
L: Cos then (?).	I-OO
F: ...but what if we click this, wait? And like connect it...	B-QS
L: Oh yeah.	B-OO
T: Oooh, who’s a smarty pants?	O
F: Yeah alright.	B-OO
T: Yeah.	O
L: There we go, save...there we go, okay. Okay work.	B-QS
F: Oh...	B-OO
L: Oh okay.	I-OO
S: We could remove that bit	B-DO
F: We can make it turn earlier, we can just make it a shorter distance and have it turn earlier.	I-DO
S: Or we can just remove that bit	I-DO
L: Okay and have it plough over the pizza.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Who cares about the pizza? we’ve got the...	B-A
F: I don’t think we, or it doesn’t even have to be that much earlier.	B-DO
T: (?)	B-OO
S: I don’t want no pizza.	I-OO
F: Huh huh. No pizza.	I-OO
S: At least not that pizza that pizza looks yucky ...no you dropped the brownie mix.	I-OO
F: Huh huh. Okay, sorry.	I-OO
S: huh huh	I-OO
L: Okay. So, shorter distance before the turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah before the final turn. So it would be this one I think. Oh it's not okay, oh you, you need to be selected on that I think.	I-ATO
L: No it's, it's this one, cos...	I-ATO
F: Oh not, er yeah it is.	B-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: Okay. You guys wanna take it? Sarah	I-OO
F: Yes. Sarah do you wanna test it?	I-OO
S: Okay. Where’d they get the treads	I-OO
S: We know how to turn it right?	O
L: The what?	B-OO
S: The treads where’d they get them?	I-OO
T: That piece?	O
S: Yes.	B-OO
T: (?).	O
L: Oh,	B-OO
S: (?) turn the	I-OO
T: axle forwards and (axle) backwards and then turn.	O
L: Alright	B-OO
F: Ready?	I-OO
S: So right here?	B-A
F: It was more like there.	I-A
L: Sarah why don’t you do the rest of the programming?	B-OO
F: Alright, yeah, Banbury Cheese.	I-OO
L: Banbury two	I-OO
F: Banbury two.	I-OO
L: Yes.	I-OO
