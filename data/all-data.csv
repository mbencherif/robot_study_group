F: Was it like here?	B-A
L: I think so.	I-A
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Think we’re ready.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
F: Oh, you just started in the wrong place.	B-A
L: Yeah I started at the wrong spot.	I-A
F: Oh, whoops.	B-OO
S: Fiona.	I-OO
L: Fiona you just do that when we do it.	I-OO
F: Oh the robot totally did that. Thanks.	I-OO
S: So we’re almost ready to plan route two after this?	B-A
L: Well if it works.	B-OO
F: So it needs to be like this.	B-A
L: Yeah. Yep.	B-OO
F: Yay.	I-OO
L: Perfect well it needs to go a little bit further actually.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: But almost perfect.	B-DO
S: No but it's on the base.	I-DO
L: Well none of it can stick out.	I-DO
F: Alright I'm gonna change this one to two point five.	B-ATV
L: Actually Fiona I realise it's fine cos it doesn’t have to completely be on.	B-DO
F: I think it needs to be, doesn’t it need to be completely in the base rest to do stuff to it though? We should actually get two point five to be safe.	B-ATV
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: It, it shouldn’t be too hard, okay.	I-OO
L: Well let me attach.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Attachment.	B-D
F: Okay, starting a new one.	B-OO
L: Wait let me get that changed (?) you just made. Do you think it works?	B-QS
F: Alright, do you want to save it?	I-QS
L: No	B-OO
F: I think it should work.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah do you have the program for the next one?	I-OO
S: Yes I do.	I-OO
L: Okay, why dont you (?).	I-OO
F: As long as we get into the base.	B-A
S: Okay this is confusing because I used another one, so this is how we do it.  So instead of facing...	I-A
F: It might actually, oh sorry...Sarah I can interrupt for a second, if we’re going to, which one are we getting at to the green ones?	I-A
S: No the outside ones.	I-A
F: Okay, well we’re going to go back to the base, so it might be a slightly different path than what you have charted out but we could go for the green one...	I-A
S: Yeah, no I have...	B-OO
F: ...we got a plough to move the fish.	B-D
S: ...no I have a way to go back to the base, just the map intersects with each other.	B-A
F: Okay, cool.	B-OO
S: Okay so instead of exiting (?) you exit from here, you go this way, you go around the obstacle so you cant approach that one over there	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: From right up front.	B-A
S: You go like this, you circle one round, you hit this one first and you keep going around then you hit this one and I was thinking that you sort of go all the way round but apparently not and then you go back...	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: ...and you go this way but if you want to you can also get that third route in (?) You go this way and you go right round to base.	B-A
F: Okay, cool, so lets start it, lets start with move tank probably.	B-ATO
S: Hmm.	B-OO
F: So then it goes forward you know	B-ATO
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: And we want it to be facing, well do you want it facing forward or backwards this time? Forwards would be okay.	B-ATO
S: It wouldn’t matter you would just need to go (?).  So either way I guess.	I-ATO
F: Alright, erm, so how far do we need it to go, lets look at the actual table and estimate how far it is, do you want to do that Sarah?	B-A
S: Okay.	B-OO
S: Alright.	I-OO
L: Can I do the programing this time?	I-OO
F: Yeah go ahead.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: That’s fine.	I-OO
L: Just I’ll wait for you to... What is that?	I-OO
F: (I think all...)	I-OO
S: It's a kitty and a pig.	I-OO
F: I think all of us should at least get a chance to do like the programing stuff.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Because that’s like the coolest part about it, alright so Sarah lets stop drawing pigs and get to the business.	I-OO
S: Okay, excuse me that pig is a scientifical miracle.	I-OO
F: Okay, alright, so we get back...	B-A
S: Okay. Okay we start it from here.	I-A
F: Yes.	B-OO
S: And it's route would take it, wait let me look at my map.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Okay, so...	I-OO
F: So it needs to go here, here right...	B-A
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: ...it goes here and then here.	B-A
S: And then it goes this way, that way around that way.	I-A
M: Alright I have a few little announcements, the first one is that every team is gonna go and meet with some judges.	O
It's okay, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter you don’t have to be ready, nobody’s ready.  Most engineers aren’t ready.	O
L: Three months right.	B-OO
M: They’re not gonna, they’re not gonna look at your programs they’re just gonna ask you some questions about whether or not you’re enjoying today, how it's going, what you’re liking about it, so each team is gonna go out for about eight minutes, you’re all gonna be gone for the	O
40:00 same amount of time so it doesn’t impact judges, but some are gonna go early and some are gonna go later.  So it's just the girls, not the grown ups, the grown ups can stay in here, go outside, take a break whatever.  The judges will ask you to turn your microphone off while you’re talking to them and then you can put it back on when you come in here.  And I will be taking teams out to the judges.  The second thing is trying to remember all the things I had, the second thing is I've had a couple of questions about coming into base.  If any part of your robot is in base as it's coming back you can grab it, it doesn’t have to come back all the way into base, so even just a little bit touching the black line or above the black line you’re good.  Another thing when you’re saving your programs please give them names that make sense.  We’re seeing a lot of programs called program, program one program two and that’s not gonna help you when you have one minute at the table this afternoon, because you’re gonna have to try to find it and if they’re all called program you’re not gonna know which one does the fish or does the (?).  Can’t remember what the other things were.	O
F: The Banbury Cheese.	B-OO
M: (?), okay, well there was one other thing I want to tell you about, but I don’t know what it was now, so I’ll let you know when I figure it out, so get back to work and I’ll start pulling teams in about five minutes for judges.	O
L: Okay guys did you (?).	B-OO
F: We need, we need to save the different things as...	B-QS
S: Okay do you want me to finish walking you through my plan?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
S: Okay so...	I-OO
F: (?).	I-OO
S: (?) I want to look at it.	I-OO
S: Okay, so you start from here, you go to about here, you might not (?) that’s fine, you go to about here and you go that way and stop at (sink or about sink).  You go that way and you plough through the edge of that.	B-A
F: Okay. And then you go around it, oh yeah we’re not doing (?).	I-A
S: Then you loop round here, go through and then you head back.	I-A
F: We’re just talking (?) stuff.	B-OO
S: As pretty much a straight (ball) and then a diagonal curve.	B-A
LGS: Oh no you killed the pig.	O
(?) we killed a animal.	O
F: Murder.	B-OO
<laughing>.	O
F: Alright I think we...Alright lets try and do it in little steps, lets try to figure out the distance that we need to go.	B-ATV
S: What does it do if (?)...okay, how about, how far does it go for one?	I-ATV
F: Alright, lets actually have it hit the blue ball because then we get extra points for that.	B-A
L: Hmm. What?	B-OO
F: That’s cool. We should have it go (?)=	B-A
L: Oh just waiting for (?).	B-OO
F: =straight this far let’s figure out how much it needs to go to be about that far.	B-A
S: So how far would it go for one?	B-ATV
F: I'm not sure, lets figure out you know that length, lets figure out how many revolutions we need it to do to do that.	I-ATV
S: Wait put it on the table, I want to see what one revolution is.	I-ATV
F: Alright, yeah you’ve got it.	B-OO
L: Okay, why don’t...	I-OO
F: Alright we’re doing we’re gonna try to figure out what the revolutions are, are you alright?	B-ATV
L: Yeah, can you just, figure out if that is like good enough so it all saves so I can delete this and start the new one.	B-QS
F: I think it's saved, I think that, oh wait, lets just save it one more time just to make sure.	I-QS
L: Well I want to make that has everything, was that everything that there is?	B-OO
F: Yeah I think so, lets, how do we save the, how do we save the new name for the thing?	B-QS
L: Do you want just like check it on the	B-OO
T: How do you do what?	O
F: So it's not pro...how do we save it so it's not named program?	B-QS
T: I think you just click on it, click on the program.	O
F: Maybe.  Oh okay, lets name it step one maybe or something like that, oh it's not typing it.  I think you need to, it's a PC so you need to use these (?).	B-QS
L: Yeah, I am.	B-OO
F: You need to double click maybe.	B-QS
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: Okay, there it goes, we already have the thing named as Banbury Cheese so maybe we should name it like...okay Banbury step one, okay.	B-QS
L: Okay, fine, alright Banbury step one.	B-OO
F: I don’t know will that show up on it?	B-QS
T: That’s a good question.	O
F: Lets just save it and it’ll rename it probably.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah Banbury step... Well lets just call it step one.	B-QS
T: Oh just call it Banbury one because they might be putting all the programs on the same robot, so you want to know it's yours.	O
L: What?	B-OO
F: Banbury one, okay yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
T: You know what I mean they might download all the programs onto one robot.	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: I'm not sure.	O
L: Okay, lets make a new one then, okay I'm going to unplug	B-OO
F: Yes. Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay are we ready to delete this stuff?	I-OO
F: Yeah, or we can make a new one, if you do like a plus thing that might make a new, new program.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah and now lets...alright so we just want to make it go, we just need to figure out what the certain distance forward should be, it's basically going to be all right angle turns so it shouldn’t be too hard.	B-ATO
L: So...	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Well there’s one turn which isn’t a right angle it's a diagonal but it should be easier, you just need to get it partially on base then we’re good.	B-ATO
L: What? No	B-OO
F: No, no, no, no...	I-OO
L: How do I get this to not delete?	B-QS
F: If you, and then...	I-QS
L: Yeah (?). Yeah okay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Righteo.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: What do we start with?	B-ATO
F: Alright so we’re gonna start with tank probably.	I-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: And then we need to just figure out how many revolutions it needs to make to go forward a certain distance.	B-ATV
S: But...first we need to know how...	B-A
F: It's just about this much.	B-ATV
S: ...how far it goes forward.	B-A
F: One revolution, so we should just do some testing for	B-ATV
L: Okay	B-OO
F: What the revolution is, so.	B-ATV
L: What do you want to start three?	I-ATV
F: One.	I-ATV
S: Just start with one row.	I-ATV
F: Start with one.	I-ATV
L: What, (?) eleven.	I-ATV
F: Eleven, lets play it.	I-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Wait I need that napkin.	I-OO
F: Oh, why is it, oh that’s, right, okay.	I-OO
S: Wait I need a napkin, put it on the table because it isn’t gonna go off.	I-OO
F: Okay, do you want to do it again just so we can...	I-OO
L: Sure.	I-OO
S: Okay, put it on the table.	I-OO
F: Yeah I'm ready. We probably need two of those, or two and a half?	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Okay, does that look good?	B-DO
S: Lets see.	B-OO
L: Do you want it further guys?	B-DO
F: Erm, I think that should be good.	I-DO
L: Okay, what next?	B-OO
F: We can like (?)	I-OO
S: You turn left.	B-ATO
F: ...yeah so we want it to be turning to the left at like ninety degrees.	B-ATV
L: Which is large motor (?).	B-QS
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: What are you going for now?	O
F: We’re going for the two at the back to knock those over, so we’re gonna make like a bunch of just like (?)...turns to get there.	B-A
L: Okay B or C?	B-ATV
F: I think that it's, let me see...	I-ATV
L: You wanna turn which direction?	I-ATV
F: B so...I think it would be B.	I-ATV
L: Hmm okay.	B-OO
F: And I think it was like one point three five that made it like a good turn.	B-ATV
L: Okay, well let’s save that one.	B-OO
F: Yeah, sure.	I-OO
F: Oh we want to go the other way, so it should be C.	B-ATV
L: C.	I-ATV
S: Okay C but same amount of turn.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: What next?	I-OO
F: Let’s just do it, just to see what (?).	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
M: You’re the first one’s up, get it out the way (?).	O
F: Maybe it should be one point two five, I don’t know.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright let me reset it.	I-OO
L: Want to say that?	I-OO
F: Yeah, yeah, yeah that’s good.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright and then that’s gonna take us, we’re going to need to go about, we’re gonna need to go this far, oh oops, oh yeah, okay so we’re going, so we’re gonna want to do move tank I think.	B-A
L: Okay, what?	B-OO
F: And I think it's going to probably just be one.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just to start with, but...lets see what it looks like.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah do you wanna be in charge of watching the robot and making sure that’s going the right distance?	I-OO
F: I don’t know maybe like one and a half.	B-ATV
L: Because it's also really helpful if you’re someone’s on the floor, so Fiona can be in the chair and you can be on the floor.	B-OO
S: Okay. Wait pass me the map please?	I-OO
L: Okay are you ready?	I-OO
50:00 F: Mm no I'm not. Alright. I think that’s kind of.	B-NSTO
S: Hmm let me see, so it's turning right from about here to here, so... So it starts there then be... Yeah roughly.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay, what do you do next?	I-OO
F: Erm...	I-OO
L: A turn.	B-ATO
F: Yes we want another one point two five turn probably, might want to test it out in C also.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I’ll add this, what portB or C?	I-ATV
F: We want it to turn, okay it's going that way, so we want it to be turning right.	B-ATO
L: You want B.	B-ATV
F: So it's B.	I-ATV
L: And you said one point	I-ATV
F: two five I think.	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: That’s like the (?).	I-OO
L: Okay. Right okay I’m gonna save it	B-QS
F: Alright. Sarah you want to watch.	B-OO
L: Wait can I...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: This is saved right?	B-QS
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay lets test out Banbury Two, ready to test it out Sarah?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Oh. yeah.	I-OO
F: Shall we, okay.	I-OO
L: Okay. Where are you guys starting?	B-A
F: I think we’re starting like here.	I-A
L: Yeah like that?	I-A
F: But like probably there, yeah.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright so it’s Banbury two. Yeah.	I-OO
S: Okay we want it to go a bit farther this way though.	B-DO
F: Yeah we want it to go a little further so we can maybe knock off a blue ball or (?).	I-DO
S: Yeah, just.	B-OO
L: Okay, righto.	I-OO
S: All yours.	I-OO
F: Well I think that it's, which one, I think that it's um  step three after (?).	B-ATO
S: No think it's step...	I-ATO
F: Step one?	I-ATO
S: Yeah one.	I-ATO
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah so we should maybe make it two point seven five.	B-ATV
L: You want it to be three	I-ATV
F: Maybe.	B-OO
L: because it actually didn’t go that far.	B-DO
F: Yeah I think it should be three yeah.	B-ATV
L: Okay, alright what do you want next? Forward right?	B-ATO
F: Want it to go, where did it end up?	B-DO
L: It was like facing forward, Fiona I think it needs to go forward now.	B-ATO
F: Yeah I think it needs to go forward, but we’re going to need to make it go, Lyn we’re gonna need to make it go forward and then turn and then go forward.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So...there’s a couple more steps.	B-ATO
L: Yeah, well how far do you think it should be like three again? Probably.	B-ATV
F: I don’t know we’re not, we don’t wanna, I think it should actually be like one because we’re not trying to get it all the way to the back or further at that point, we’re trying to get it a little bit past the trailer and then turn again and then go to the back.	I-ATV
L: Okay, how about one point five.	I-ATV
F: Yeah sure.	B-OO
L: Or two five.	B-ATV
F: Yeah sure.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Then you need to turn again.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: C (?)	B-ATV
F: Yeah think so...wait... Yes C.	I-ATV
L: Okay. How far?	I-ATV
F: One point two five I guess, because that’s the	I-ATV
L: No don’t want (?) five. Okay.	I-ATV
F: Okay	B-OO
L: And then.	I-OO
F: Do you wanna save it and try it out?	I-OO
L: Hold on I think I want to go, lets like finish up with the forward.	B-ATO
F: Yeah, er	B-OO
L: Where you say one point two?	B-ATV
F: Er oh we need to figure out how much...	I-ATV
L: Already did that one.	B-OO
F: ...oh wait.	I-OO
L: How do you I connect this to this?	B-QS
F: Maybe it needs to, click on the orange thing, there might be like a connector (?) control.	I-QS
L: This one.	I-QS
F: And then, I don’t know I don’t think so delete that one maybe.	I-QS
L: Sarah are you okay?	B-OO

T: Oh maybe, did that come off the truck?	B-OO
K: No.	I-OO
A: No::::	I-OO
T: Oh you know what let’s look at...	O
A: Get this thing out of here I am done with it.	B-OO
G: Katie	I-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: (excuse me) I need to keep, I need to fix it again.	I-OO
K: Okay. Maybe we should like re, reprogram it.	I-OO
G: Yeah I'm gonna do, just another one. Copy this like...	I-OO
A: Found it.	I-OO
K: Need some coffee.	I-OO
G: Go get some coffee.	I-OO
K: Okay	I-OO
A: The bottom off here.	I-OO
T: Oh okay. (?).	O
K: Hey.	B-OO
A: Fender, bender.	I-OO
T: Yup. Huh huh huh	O
K: What? Andi do you wanna have a coffee break?	B-OO
A: Um Georgie do you want to go get coffee (break?)	I-OO
G: I can’t have coffee.	I-OO
A: Okay, do you want to go get a water and coffee break?	I-OO
G: No thanks I wanna finish this.	I-OO
A: Okay, we’re gonna go.	I-OO
T: Take a break?	O
A: Five minutes.	B-OO
K: Coffee break.	I-OO
T: Okay.	O
A: (Set the) timer for five minutes.	B-OO
K: I need more energy or and caffeine.	I-OO
A: Okay, five minutes that’s what we got. Then she can take a break for five minutes, we gotta have someone (?) break. The coffee’s over here.	I-OO
K: I really don’t care but okay. (?)	I-OO
K: I'm just gonna take a little.	I-OO
A: Okay that’s fine I'm sure.	I-OO
K: Oh god we need to warm it up. Oh wait no. Here, thirty seconds. That thirty seconds just...	I-OO
A: Oh there you go. And they have cream and sugar.	I-OO
K: It's like so fancy, everything here is so fancy. Why does it have to be so fancy? Not saying anything (?) I'm not hating just saying. I need caffeine in my system.	I-OO
A: Oh gosh it's hot now. Really hot (?).	I-OO
K: Not too hot.	I-OO
A: I'm gonna take twenty seconds.	I-OO
K: Do you want some coffee?	I-OO
T: I’m all set.	O
A: Watch as you pour the whole thing in there.	B-OO
K: (?) just pour the whole thing.	I-OO
A: Wait.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: They’re still recording us remember.	I-OO
K: Oh, oh gosh.	I-OO
A: We’re not drinking coffee we’re not like thirteen and drinking coffee, just saying.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
M: Seven minute warning. It’s a little while yeah another team’s just gone.	O
A: Okay. Got enough.	B-OO
K: I got a lot, a lot, I like mine with a lot, a lot of cream.	I-OO
A: Me too. Except I’ve never really had like a powdered creamer.	I-OO
K: Yeah me neither, I usually either use half and half.	I-OO
A: Where did you put the spoon?	I-OO
K: Oh I'm using it.	I-OO
A: Yeah I’ll just use hers.	I-OO
K: We’re totally not using coffee, we’re totally not drinking coffee.	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
G: You guys just one thing, it has to start all the way in the base.	B-A
A: A little bit more.	B-OO
K: Way too small to be a kitchen there’s no oven it’s definitely not a kitchen.	I-OO
G: How did (?) create this, it's making me hungry just	I-OO
looking at  it	O
<general classroom chatter>	O
G: Actually it doesn’t have to be all the way (?).	B-A
K: I feel like a grown up now.	B-OO
A: Why?	I-OO
K: Because I'm being in a college and I'm drinking coffee.	I-OO
A: This creamer is so clumping.	I-OO
K: At a fancy table	I-OO
A: Is your coffee cream clumping?	I-OO
K: No.	I-OO
A: Mine is.	I-OO
G: No they just went to take a coffee and water break.	I-OO
A: (It’s really) (?).	I-OO
K: (Mix it up better)	I-OO
M: (The alignment) really matters. Did you make it note of where it was placed that time?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: I just need caffeine. What are you doing? Oh my god.	I-OO
A: (?)	I-OO
K: It's caffeine. That can happen, caffeine makes you more energetic right, so why shouldn’t it energize your skin or whatever. Whatever that means	I-OO
A: Oh.	I-OO
K: I don’t even make sense to myself.	I-OO
A: Oops okay then.	I-OO
K: That just shows you how weird I am.	I-OO
G: Now we’re...	I-OO
T: (?)	O
A: It’s five minutes.	B-OO
K: Shhh. It’s only been about two minutes	I-OO
A: Just did it again	I-OO
K: That’s totally not five minutes right now that was just two minute warning and we’re totally not drinking coffee right now.	I-OO
A: Shhh.	I-OO
K: Are we drinking coffee?	I-OO
A: Obviously not. Phew, how could water be coffee?	I-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
G: Well when it starts here we go up and then back up and then we go straight to the yellow truck.	B-ATO
A: We’re just drinking water.	B-OO
G: But when this works. It’s got the yellow ball	B-A
K: The coffee beans, crushed coffee beans and sugar, it's totally not coffee.	B-OO
A: Oh my god this is so cool.	I-OO
K: Why are you...	I-OO
K: I'm kind of worried about the programming? Whatever we do it doesn’t seem to work.	I-OO
A: Well we keep like, well the program we have right now isn’t like when we first designed it, it wasn’t (for).	I-OO
Huh, hum. What are you guys looking at?	I-OO
K: I'm thinking we should do, I'm thinking we should (?) the program itself.	I-OO
A: What we’re doing now wasn’t from that angle we were doing something different. Do you think they can hear me if I keep tapping my finger on (?).	I-OO
K: I think they can hear your tapping. Wait I wanna blow on my microphone, try to blow really loudly. I don’t think they hear, they, I think they heard it.	I-OO
A: That should be enough.	I-OO
K: What are you doing?	I-OO
A: More cream it’s like pancake batter. I kinda want some potato chips.	I-OO
K: We have to go now.	I-OO
A: No we don’t. Shh:::::	I-OO
K: We totally have to go now.	I-OO
A: Do you want to get some potato chips for me	I-OO
K: Coffee and potato chips.	I-OO
A: Yes.	I-OO
K: Perfect combo. (Just take a big plate) (?)	I-OO
A: Yep. I know how it rolls.	I-OO
K: Sure you do.	I-OO
A: Close enough?	I-OO
K: Who’s your home teacher?	I-OO
A: Mr Casey.	I-OO
K: D you know Jimmi	I-OO
A: Yeah. Mm kind of. I mean we’re friends but not close friends. Don’t go (there).	I-OO
K: (?). Just look how modern it all looks though, doesn’t it look modern?	I-OO
A: No. It looks like a dumpster. Oh for those of you who are listening in right now I was being sarcastic.	I-OO
K: So don’t get mad at us,	I-OO
A: Yeah. Wait, he cant hear us, separate talking.	I-OO
K: Oh.	I-OO
A: Oh.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: bum, bum, bum.	B-OO
K: He was probably like (why the heck are they saying) don’t get mad at us.	I-OO
A: Because we just said that...	I-OO
K: (?).	O
A: (?)	O
K: I have (?) really small and just put it on your (?) something like a (?).	B-OO
A: I was thinking that we’re gonna have to like put this like underneath our shirts make some secret talking (?).	I-OO
G: Not yet (?)	I-OO
A: I'm just trying to make sure no one’s (?). Be like James Bond movie or something. In this modern facility, actually that would totally work. I’m trying to get upstairs. Dun dun dun.	I-OO
K: I actually want to see what those guys (?).	I-OO
A: Hmm. Let’s go.	I-OO
K: (They made) me curious.	I-OO
A: Let’s go	I-OO
20:00 K: (They’re) staring at us, I'm scared.	I-OO
A: Okay nobody’s looking, the doors right over there.	I-OO
K: Okay shut it quietly. Shut it quietly.	I-OO
K: By the way (?) we’re really not trying to go upstairs.	I-OO
A: Totally not	I-OO
K: Just kidding, oh my gosh that makes it sound like we’re being sarcastic and we’re actually trying to go upstairs, but we’re not.	I-OO
A: Obviously not (?).	I-OO
G: Oh we’re next for the interview.	I-OO
K: What?	I-OO
G: What?	I-OO
A: We’re taking a coffee break and potato chip break.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: Well we’re up next for the interview and I still need your help back inside the (?).	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Here, want some potato chips?	I-OO
G: No thank you.	I-OO
K: No. Georgie	I-OO
G: Okay thank you.	I-OO
A: Oh...I want to eat my potato chips.	I-OO
K: Oh well, time to go.	I-OO
A: How’s it doing?	I-OO
G: That’s okay.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
K: This has, Eve has a mind of her own.	B-NSTO
A: She does something that...	B-OO
G: She brought it back to the base.	B-DO
K: We should go now.	B-OO
A: Does something different every single time.	B-DO
G: That’s hilarious. Okay can I have Eve please?	B-OO
K: We should go.	I-OO
G: Not yet they haven’t called us. No I don’t want to delete it.	I-OO
A: Well that would push it over.	B-DO
G: Oh no...	B-OO
FT: What are you trying to do?	O
G: We’re trying to get the yellow and the blue ball.	B-A
FT: Oh, okay.	O
G: So lets see, (?) the ball and back on Katie. We’re extremely talented at this.	B-OO
A: Oh yeah.	I-OO
K: Eve why?	I-OO
A: Why?	I-OO
K: We’re working so hard and you’re not letting us do what we want.	I-OO
A: We shouldn’t have named it Eve it sounds like an evil.	I-OO
G: Come on.	I-OO
K: Eve is...	I-OO
A: Dun nu nu	I-OO
G: Can you return this to the table.	I-OO
K: No we have to bring this with us.	I-OO
M: (Girly gators) bring your robot, turn off your microphones.	O
A: What?	B-OO
K: You hear that? You’re not gonna listen to anything I say anymore, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, they’re not gonna hear what were gonna say anymore.	I-OO
<Microphones turned off whilst with judges until 26:50 >	O
K: You can listen to me now.	B-OO
FT: Turn it back back on?	O
K: Yep on.	B-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: We’re back people.	I-OO
K: You can listen to us now it's okay, you don’t have to worry about us saying something, we’re still friends, we’re friends.	I-OO
G: Excuse me	I-OO
A: Right there.	I-OO
K: We’re friends. Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve. Eve stop.	B-NSTO
A: Not working.	I-NSTO
FH: (?) into the wall.	O
A: It was not it went over the fence.	B-DO
G: It was working though. It ran over the...doing it what we want it to do.	B-NSTO
A: Huh. Hold on I'm gonna go try and program some stuff I guess.	B-OO
G: What are you doing?	I-OO
A: Working.	I-OO
K: I have an idea, we should all go...you just almost killed the person who was listening to me, now you can’t hear anything because of the sticker. I swear this is got to be the death of a lot people.	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
K: Oh my god, what are you doing Eve.	B-NSTO
A: Well it does very good parallel parking.	B-OO
K: Yeah it does. I have an idea we should all go to all the group and say hi and meet them and so we can get ideas. Buh huh huh. I am so evil.	I-OO
GT: Good luck	O
A: Well all we have to do now is program this and we’re all set on other things (?).	B-OO
K: Wait Eve, Eve.	I-OO
A: We don’t have to do top secret stuff.	I-OO
G: I like this table better. This one’s better.	I-OO
K: Eve messed up my plans, I swear he will, she will.	I-OO
A: What if they turn off our microwaves saying that	I-OO
G: Microwaves?	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: Microwaves	B-OO
K: Eve, why do you...	I-OO
A: Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve.	B-NSTO
G: Yes	B-OO
A: Oh my god it didn’t even touch it.	B-DO
G: Boo::::	B-OO
A: Yes it worked. It literally hit all the other fish except (?).	B-DO
G: (?) blowing up.	B-OO
K: How did you have that angled.	B-A
G: I don’t even know. (?) Okay do it again I swear.	B-OO
A: I'm gonna video tape it this time and then we’ll try and like figure it out.	I-OO
K: It was like Neil Armstrong not blowing up while he was flying to sp- the moon.	I-OO
G: And why?	I-OO
A: What?	I-OO
G: Neil Armstrong did blow up.	I-OO
K: Yeah exactly.	I-OO
A: Could you put the ball back?	I-OO
K: Oops, sorry about that.	I-OO
A: Hold on let me video tape it so we actually get it right.	I-OO
K: Yeah video tape it, video tape it on my one.	I-OO
A: Darn it, now we don’t know the angle.	B-A
G: Yeah I do.	B-OO
K: Um. Okay, you can (?).	I-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Just kill the truck.	B-NSTO
A: This thing is just playing a world domination.	I-NSTO
K: Eve why do you do this to us.	B-OO
G: Oops.	I-OO
A: You dropped the fruit.	B-DO
G: (?).	B-OO
K: No the fruit all died too.	I-OO
G: Oh my gosh.	I-OO
K: Eve you’re evil, Eve we named you Eve.	I-OO
G: It is not evil. She’s just different.	I-OO
30:00 K: No she’s not different. She was bo-	I-OO
A: She’s evil.	I-OO
K: No she’s not evil because she was in school, school um brain washes you.	I-OO
G: School does not brain wash you.	I-OO
K: Yes it does.	I-OO
G: No it doesn’t.	I-OO
K: School brain washes you, am I right the person who is just listening to me right now.	I-OO
A: Hold on, hold on (?) hold on...	I-OO
K: Don’t, don’t, don’t...	I-OO
G: Let it go.	I-OO
K: No, no, no no not yet, no I asked you not yet.	I-OO
A: Nope that’s a fail.	B-NSTO
K: Ah. No, you just spread ebola.	B-OO
((laughter))	O
K: Eve spread ebola now. Eve spread ebola. Eve spread ebola.	B-OO
G: Oh my gosh.	I-OO
K: Georgie Georgie	I-OO
G: Shut up	I-OO
K: Georgie	I-OO
G: Shut up	I-OO
K: Georgie	I-OO
G: Shut up	I-OO
K: Eve spread ebola	I-OO
A: And she didn’t knock any corn out.	B-DO
K: Yes.	B-OO
A: She didn’t hit anything.	B-DO
G: (?) try this again.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: This time I'm not failing.	I-OO
K: Wait don’t touch it unless I say go. Okay. Eh uh	I-OO
A: Hold on. The cow’s (ear)	I-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Eve.	B-OO
A: Okay just get rid of that thing, get rid of it, get rid of it, get of it.	I-OO
K: Why? Eve I swear you’re trying to kill humanity, no Eve is the step of world domination, this is just some prediction that she’s trying to show us.	I-OO
G: Oh do you know what I had it angled the wrong way. Oops.	B-A
A: It works if we angle it the right way.	I-A
G: I had angled the wrong way, yeah I know, it kind of helps if you angle it the right way.	I-A
A: No,	B-OO
K: Don’t... No the baby fish. You killed the baby fish. Now the fish population is decreasing.	B-A
G: And like you didn’t kill fish before.	I-A
A: Get the bacteria, get the bacteria over there.	I-A
K: I never killed the fish.	I-A
A: Oh my god...	B-NSTO
K: Wait. Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve. I I wanna do something, okay did you go like this, except this is (?).	B-OO
K: (No) (fab) , I was trying to try somethi-, fine fine fine. You know what I'm gonna do? I just really wanna do this.	I-OO

G: Hey guys, can I see Evie for a second?	B-OO
A: Keep it going.	B-DO
G: Can I see Eve?	B-OO
A: Okay that (ain’t) working.	B-NSTO
G: Can I see Eve please?	B-OO
K: Okay try, try to set it up and...	B-A
A: We need Eve, we need Eve.	B-OO
G: Andi, Katie. Can I see Eve please.	I-OO
A: We need Eve.	I-OO
G: Guys,	I-OO
K: Ready, set...	I-OO
G: No we need Eve.	I-OO
K: Oh.	I-OO
G: Thank you. Because I have a different idea.	B-A
A: Go ahead try it.	B-OO
G: Wait ‘til it (?).	I-OO
A: Okay, maybe we should use the sensor, wait where’s the sensor?	B-A
K: Oh by the way, look what I found? Georgie, I think you might want to come.	B-QS
A: Here it is.	B-D
G: Hold on.	B-OO
A: We’re gonna need it.	B-D
G: That doesn’t work.	B-NSTO
A: Okay  nowhere close.	I-NSTO
T: (Got back there) okay that was, you got it back there...	O
A: Start forward more. Or do you wanna use (?).	B-A
T: (?)	O
A: Go.	B-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Okay so less back, or do you wanna use a sensor so it will stop	B-ATO
G: Not on this page please because  that’s where I have my...	B-OO
K: Okay so I make a new one?	B-QS
G: collision control to (?) I need to fix something.	B-OO
A: Here, can I see that other robot thingy?	I-OO
G: Katie can you fix this please?	I-OO
K: Yeah I'm trying to.	I-OO
A: You... will go back	B-D
G: Can I see Eva. For a second	B-OO
A: One second	I-OO
G: How many points for each ball?	B-A
K: Four I think.	I-A
G: Yeah, four each so if we manage to get both that’s eight points right there. And we could figure out stuff after that.	I-A
K: Okay so can I, I download it, I'm trying something.	B-OO
G: What you doing?	I-OO
A: Gonna try and put the sensor on.	B-A
G: I don’t think we need the sensor really, there’s no program for the sensor.	I-A
A: Yeah there is.	B-OO
G: And it's (?). I'm gonna go test the collision control	I-OO
K: <singing>	O
A: I think the sensor’ll hopefully work.	B-A
G: Gosh, so close.	B-NSTO
A: Hang on let me just try putting it on.	B-D
DBS: (?) back for you guys.	O
G: Thank you. So after I fix. What do we want this on?	B-D
A: D.	I-D
G: D? okay. There we go.	I-D
A: There we go. Should either, yeah put it forward...	B-A
G: So close, (?)  two pieces of corn.	B-NSTO
A: So we just wanna go a little bit more forward.	B-DO
G: Little bit more forward and then we need to...I’ll fix the...	I-DO
A: I’ll fix it.	B-OO
G: Okay I’ll fix the...	I-OO
A: Sensor.	B-A
G: ...backwards motion.	B-ATO
K: That, that’s the program for the sensor.	B-A
G: Cool. Can I do something on that one.	B-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
G: Thank you. So the forward needs to be four, oh no forty three...	B-ATV
K: Let me, let me this (?) Eve.	B-OO
G: Four and then it needs to be...	B-ATV
A: Oh thank you.	B-OO
G: Backwards.	B-ATO
K: Negative. Let me do it.	B-OO
A: Here I’ll fix the sensor too.	B-A
K: Negative fifty?	B-ATV
G: And then, so now we’re (bring this) back...and then we need to turn	B-ATO
K: Singing	B-OO
?: (These are taps)	O
A: Or we could have the sensor up here when we move the plough up.	B-D
K: Yeah that can happen.	B-OO
T: What does the sensor do?	O
A: Stops it.	B-A
G: And. This. Then...	B-ATO
K: Oh we need to go this...	B-OO
A: Okay that’s (?) really messing me up,(?) come out	B-D
G: And then... What the heck?	B-ATO
K: It's kinda. Oh my gosh glitch, we have a glitch.	B-QS
G: It's fine.	B-OO
K: It's kind of glitching.	B-QS
T: What happened?	O
K: What’s going on?	B-OO
A: It's fine (?).	I-OO
K: (?).	I-OO
G: Okay so backwards and then, and then turn right.	B-ATO
A: Right	B-OO
G: And	I-OO
A: I'm moving this.	I-OO
K: Oh, do, do, do, do...	I-OO
A: I was just testing to make sure the sensor will work like that and it will.	B-A
K: Okay try it.	B-OO
A: I just got to plug it in now.	B-QR
K: Plug it in, try and plug it in D or 4.	I-QR
T: What kind of sensor is this?	O
K: It’ll make it stop.	B-A
A: Makes it stop once we put the plough up.	B-D
T: Okay.	O
A: So like on one of them we can do like... Once it comes back to base we can... Ah. There we go. I'm just gonna put it in A right for now.	B-D
G: Two	B-ATV
K: We’re acting like we’re really smart right now.	B-OO
T: You guys are really smart.	O
K: Okay and this...	B-OO
T: You’re building a robot, now your making it pull things.	O
A: Oh we gotta program it.	B-QR
G: I'm downloading this one back on.	B-OO
K: Okay, you’re downloading, okay go try that we’re gonna program for the sensor okay.	I-OO
A: The sensors on, it's just not doing anything right now.	B-A
K: <singing>	O
T: So you got it back to base, what’s that extra little move it does afterwards	O
A: I didn’t mean to do that I thought that it was (?).	B-NSTO
T: Yeah because once it's back there.  Like the full robot is in the base so you would be good you wouldn’t have to (?).	O
A: Here, there you go.	B-OO
G: Oh, woah okay.	I-OO
A: Then we could fix the sensor. That one’s not gonna work it’s like. (And like) flip it. I figured out why because it didn’t even hit this fish so it wasn’t in the right position.	B-DO
G: Try this again.	B-OO
A: Turn, turn, turn, there we go just...	B-DO
T: It's just pulling the right (position).	O
G: That worked so well, lets try this again.	B-NSTO
A: Let’s try this (?)	B-OO
T: Like keep track of where you have it lined up	O
G: We have it like over	B-A
T: Set	O
G: At the end and this is right next to our base.	B-A
T: She said you could make a little (?) out of legos to like...	O
A: (Here)	B-OO
K: Oh hey, what’s the sensor connect to? Which port?	B-A
A: Um. I think it's A.	I-A
K: Okay, good.	B-OO
A: If it's not I dunno	I-OO
T: That’s pretty good right there.	O
G: Still need that yellow ball (?) I need to fix something.	B-A
G: (?) going in. After you’ve done what you’re doing can I get back on the computer I need to fix something.	B-OO
K: Oh sure, try.	I-OO
A: Thank you.	I-OO
K: I think I need a break.	I-OO
G: So the forward and the back are good, the left...can I do three point five? I can so three point five back and then turn left and then (?).	B-ATV
K: (?) oh my god.	B-OO
T: (First of all). You don’t have to be ready no-one’s ready. They’re not gonna, they’re not gonna look at your programs they’re just gonna ask you some questions like whether or not you’re enjoying today, how it's going, what they (?) so each team is gonna go out for about eight minutes,	O
G: No.	B-OO
M: You’re all gonna go for the same amount of time so it doesn’t (?) so it's just the girls, not the grown ups the grown ups can stay in here, go outside, take a break whatever, the judges will ask you to turn your microphones off while you’re talking to them and I will be taking you out (?).  Second thing is I have had	O
M: questions about coming into base. If any part of your	O
M: robot is in base as it's coming back you can grab it, it doesn’t have to come back all the way into base. (?) touching the black line above the black line you’re in base,  (?). Another thing when you’re saving your program please give them names that make sense. I’m seeing a lot of programs called programing, program one, program two and that’s not gonna help you when you (?) this afternoon so find it (?).	O
K: <whispering>	B-OO
G: <whispering>	I-OO
K: How do you mean?	I-OO
G: <whispering>	I-OO
M: Okay so there was one other thing that I wanted to tell you but I forget was it was now. I’ll let you know when I figure it out. Get back to work and I’ll start pulling teams in about five minutes to see judges.	O
G: (I don’t think we need) the sensor?	B-A
K: No we’re just on...	B-OO
G: Because somebody put it on upside down and backwards.	B-D
A: Well it has to be backwards in order for it to...	I-D
K: Andi	B-OO
A: It's actually not backwards but...	B-D
K: Wait let me try something.	B-OO
G: (?)	O
K: Okay lets go and test it.	B-OO
K: Can we borrow this for a sec?	I-OO
DBF: Oh yeah we’re not (?).	O
A: How’s it working.	B-OO
K: It’s beautiful Georgie.	B-NSTO
G: It's beautiful Katie.	I-NSTO
DBF: Oh god,	O
K: No we killed an animal.	B-OO
<laughing>	O
K: No the the chicken died,	B-OO
G: Or the pig died the most.	I-OO
K: Yeah the pig died the most.	I-OO
A: Do you think ours is a little destructive?	I-OO
G: Yeah I need to fix that.	I-OO
K: We this should not be wall-e, thank god we didn’t name this wall-e. Wall-e is not destructive.  Eve is though.	I-OO
G: Eve is.	I-OO
A: So Eve,	I-OO
G: so what did I change in this.	I-OO
A: A lot.	I-OO
G: Not much though.	I-OO
K: ((singing))	O
A: No I'm just kidding.	B-OO
G: So...so it turns left.	B-ATO
A: Should go...	B-OO
G: Oh you know what I did I had it back up by three point five	B-ATV
K: Ooooo	B-OO
G: Instead of three, I think it should, I should back up four.	B-ATV
K: Um try three for a bit	I-ATV
G: Okay	B-OO
K: And if it doesn’t work we can just go to four.	B-ATV
A: Right, oh it's not plugged in.	B-QR
G: Thank you.	B-OO
A: You’re all set to download.	I-OO
K: Yeah,	I-OO
G: Downloading.	I-OO
G: There it is	I-OO
A: Do we want to take off the sensor?	B-D
K: No we’re, we’re gonna test to see how it works if not then	B-OO
A: There’s something that lights up.	I-OO
K: Oh I'm finding that.	I-OO
A: Oh that’s so cool.	I-OO
G: Oh there it is.	I-OO
A: I like the headlights for accessories.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Georgie Georgie we should add this for accessory.	I-OO
A: Yes.	I-OO
G: Let’s take this off then.	B-D
K: Yeah and then...	B-OO
A: Give me it. Give me it, I’ll go fix it.	I-OO
K: I’ll get a cord.	B-D
G: No I’ll fix (this).	I-D
A: (Georgie) you broke it, you broke it.	B-OO
K: I can do this	I-OO
G: I didn’t break it I just did this.	B-D
K: I want to feel useful.	B-OO
G: Here.	I-OO
A: Here I’ll go...	I-OO
G: I can, I can do this I want to be useful.	I-OO
A: I got it. Here.	I-OO
G: This isn’t coming out.	B-D
A: (?) do it.	B-OO
K: Just rip out the chord.	B-D
A: You have to go like that.	I-D
G: Oh okay, (?) the ice, I want to (?). It's not doing it.	I-D
A: Have to wait for it to turn on. (Dude) we probably want it down because then it will be more sturdy.	I-D
K: ((singing))	B-OO
A: Okay I need the, this, just go in there, I need that other piece to go on there, close enough, no it doesn’t go in all the way unless we want to add it. No just put it through	B-D
G: That one.	I-D
A: Hmm, hmm. And we’re supposed to do the other one?	I-D
G: Did you get it?	B-OO
A: Yeah now you take these and you pull them so it stays.	B-D
G: Okay hold on I’ll just put that back in.	I-D
A: There	B-OO
G: There, they’re not exactly centered but pretty cool.	B-D
A: Oh you can just move it	I-D
G: Oh god. Move that to the middle I’ll put it back in here I’ll hold, I’ll hold on to this here, there we go perfect.	I-D
A: Oops.	B-OO
G: Number five is alive (for a second).	I-OO
A: Okay well I can put it back one hole or something but that’s, oh the chord, the chord, the chord there we go.	B-D
G: The chord.	I-D
K: Did we get it? Did we get it?	B-OO
A: Yeah there’s a (?).	I-OO
K: It's not (?).	I-OO
A: Oh my god I have to go fix this.	B-D
K: Yeah, yeah. I'm so tired.	B-OO
A: It's not gonna work because see now it's dragging on the ground.	B-D
K: I will be right back.	B-OO
A: I’ll be fixing this.	I-OO
G: Put it on top.	B-D
A: Damn.	B-OO
G: Oh my gosh. Shit. Sugar.	I-OO
K: Guys do you remember (?)?	I-OO
G: Mmm (banana). Banana	I-OO
A: That really sounded like you said a bad word but I know you didn’t.	I-OO
G: Because I'm a good person.	I-OO
A: I know.	I-OO
G: Uh uh uh	I-OO
A: Oh they’re here, right here.	B-D
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: Okay let me try putting my end first. In...	B-D
G: Like right here?	I-D
A: No, no, no one more back. Ah. I got my end from pushing.	I-D
G: That will so drag.	I-D
A: That’s okay it sounds bad.	B-OO
G: I just don’t think we need this.	B-D
A: Here let me fix it, I got it.	I-D
K: Eve needs eyes though.	I-D
A: .hhh Why don’t we just put it on top.	I-D
K: Oh come on.	I-D
A: We can put it right here.	I-D
K: Hey guys I, I need to try something.	B-OO
G: We still need to test our last plan.	I-OO
A: Yeah we’ll just put it like that.	B-D
K: Oh (?).	B-OO
A: Oh I have something that will do that, I need this.	I-OO
G: Wait I have an idea.	I-OO
A: I got it.	B-D
G: We need an L Shape. We have L shaped one somewhere.	I-D
K: We were trying to do sensor (?) but it didn’t work.	B-A
T: What do you need the sensor to do?	O
K: It was supposed to stop.	B-A
G: Okay let me put this here and we’re gonna attach it.	B-D
A: Yeah that’s what I was thinking because that’s what I have right here.	I-D
G: Oh.	B-OO
T: (?) eyes now too.	O
G: Yeah	B-OO
T: That’s cool	O
A: It needs to see.	B-OO
G: Here I’ll do this on each side.	B-D
K: I  want this computer I want a touch screen.	B-OO
G: Unless...	I-OO
K: Oh lets see.	I-OO
A: Make it longer.	B-D
G: Okay let’s take this one.	I-D
A: Big one or small one?	I-D
K: Got it.	B-OO
A: Hey do you want something smaller?	B-D
G: No I like this one.	I-D
K: (I think that's what it is).	B-OO
M: You’re the first ones up (?).	I-OO
K: Okay I've been missing all of this.	B-D
A: Then we go with this, we can put that through.	B-ATO
K: I'm fix, I'm, I'm doing the lighting, are we doing that?	B-D
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: What’s in the second one? Right here.	B-D

K:  and so lets say this is right, like right here we can turn around we can kind of like push it to a wall, pop it up and then move it, like so it goes like this, down to the base.	B-A
A: Hold on	B-OO
K: So it's kind of like a little...	B-D
A: We’ll have to find a way to attach it.	I-D
K: Yeah, yeah a plough just goes like brm	I-D
G: Yeah	B-OO
K: And that would also help us if we’re trying to do the bacteria like (?).	B-A
A: Well the plough can work with the bacteria.	I-A
G: Here.	B-OO
K: Oh that’s (the scrubber) thing.	B-DO
A: That didn’t work.	B-NSTO
G: Yeah that didn’t work. Back to the drawing board.	I-NSTO
A: Wait, I have an idea, give me this stupid thing, hold on lets try it like this.	B-A
G: Wait I still need to program it.	B-OO
A: I know, one second, I'm just testing something.	I-OO
K: Um where’s the robot?	I-OO
G: She has it.	I-OO
K: Here, let me try. Let me try this. Okay.	B-A
G: The corn machine.	B-OO
K: Okay lets try this.	B-A
G: Okay go ahead.	B-OO
<singing>	O
A: Oh go go.	B-OO
K: It’s not letting me	B-QR
A: All you have to do is press the center button.	I-QR
K: It's not working.	B-NSTO
G: Can you please bring back the...	B-OO
K: We got some malfunctioning going on.	B-QR
G: Well I’ll just do another.	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: So I fixed this one I think.	B-D
A: So the (program’s) all set	B-OO
G: (I don’t think we need) this, I'm so sorry.	B-D
A: I know it's okay. We could attach it to the back.	I-D
G: I'm just gonna take this off, it’s still together.	I-D
A: See because we can have it go...okay somewhere, oh...	B-A
Spin come back, plough. Ha ha ha	I-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: I,I,I can see (?)	I-OO
G: Go I had it come down here and then turn and then it turned, so it needs to move forward once and then turn left and then move forward once. Okay so everything back in the position (?).	B-ATV
A: I will fix everything you can go on program I can fix.	B-OO
G: Okay Katie	I-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
G: I know how to fix this, excuse me.	I-OO
K: Okay. I really just want to try the program, but okay.	I-OO
G: You can program the next one when we try to figure out what we’re gonna do next.	I-OO
A: Um our robot can move the thing. We got a plough.	B-D
G: And then, this one, left and then one more...	B-ATO
A: I got it.	B-D
G: I can’t move this over.	B-SO
A: I fixed it. I think I fixed it.	B-D
K: I'm studying on how, on, where the bacteria will fall. Oh. Oh	B-A
G: No I didn’t.	B-OO
K: No. You guys have red eyes, oh can I see?	I-OO
A: (Sure.)	I-OO
K: Oh that’s so cool, that’s so cool.	I-OO
A: We’re focusing on our own.	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Because we have some issues, that we need to address...	I-OO
K: Are you borrowing this?	I-OO
DBF: (?)	O
K: Oh yeah sure.	B-OO
DBF: Thanks.	O
K: Okay so, here test it a bit to see how it will work.	B-OO
G: We need to, instead of these two, two right motions, what can we (do) that to?	B-ATO
K: We can probably make one right and one (?)the other one left.	I-ATO
G: That (instead).	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: Let’s try, lets test it for a sec	B-A
G: Okay	B-OO
K: And then we’ll (?). Oh, (?).	I-OO
G: (?)	I-OO
K: I can program how, we can try to get the fish.	B-A
G: You start programming one all about fish.	I-A
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: I think I figured out the plough. Now. Because now it's not touching the ground.	B-D
K: That’s fine. ((sings)) Miss Rosman how do you make it (so both) like (b and ).	B-QS
T: You, you can (shift it along).	O
K: Yeah I know how to shift it I just don’t know how to put it (both).	B-QS
T: Put it so it's right in the middle, are you trying to (are you talking about the steering).	O
K: Yeah like, no both the wheels turn the same.	B-QS
T: Both the wheels turn the same,	O
K: Hm	B-OO
T:  So if you want it to, if you want it to turn you just have to program one wheel to move faster than the other so there was...	O
K: No, no, no like how to get them both.	B-QS
T: How to get them both...	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
DBT: (?)	O
G: No.	B-OO
<laughing>	O
G: Look at this.	B-OO
T: I know that’s...	O
A: Okay here let me touch this because I fixed the plough.	B-D
G: Okay we’ll try that on it. But we still need to get the yellow ball.	B-A
A: Oh that’s what we’re trying...	I-A
G: Yeah that’s what we’re aiming for.	I-A
A: Okay let me er fix, if you grab that I can fix the corn hopper.	B-OO
G: So...okay.	I-OO
K: Hmm, what’s this, this is a sensor.	B-QS
G: Okay you put the blue back.	B-OO
A: Oh, oh my god you’ve made a mess.	I-OO
G: Oh my gosh. Look it. This is all knocked over, that was all knocked over you got the (?) off of it.	B-DO
A: Do you know how many points that is?	B-OO
G: (?) round here.	I-OO
T: Really?	O
K: Lets try that, I wanna see that.	B-OO
T: I wanna see that too.	O
G: Oh don’t forget to move the fish back.	B-OO
K: Go.	I-OO
G: Oh it didn’t work that time.	B-NSTO
K: It was it is a bit off	B-DO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: It worked that time. Oh my gosh.	B-NSTO
T: But then you would, then you would just have to figure out how to get it back to base and then you get points for that, you get points for the balls.	O
A: This didn’t go off.	B-DO
T: Yeah.	O
A: Oh my god why is this not working.	B-NSTO
T: (?) stop over there. (?) make it go backwards and then like turn (?) come this way maybe.	O
A: Yeah I’ll pick up the bacterias okay	B-OO
G: okay I'm going go finish programing, okay.	I-OO
K: I need help, how do you like make sure that both of the wheels I didn’t really catch that?	B-QS
G: But I need to do something to make sure that this will be able to come back.	B-ATO
K: Okay.	B-OO
T: (?) trying to figure out how to make (?)	O
K: No she already did that.	B-OO
T: She already did that.	O
G: I'm just want to make this page bigger but I can’t.	B-SO
T: Can you	O
G: Wait?	B-OO
T: Yeah that’s what I was wondering, that was, that’s exactly what I was thinking, (?) can you make those smaller.	O
G: So then, we should do everything in reverse.	B-ATO
K: Wait, what let me try to do this?	B-OO
G: Not now please I need to finish. Programing it to see if it...okay go ahead but I'm finishing programing it so it’ll go back to base and then we’ll get those points.	B-ATO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
G: So I need it to...	B-ATO
A: Now we got the plough working...	B-D
G: Turn around.	B-ATO
A: Go (?). Oh my god. Hold on.	B-OO
K: Just click on it or program.	B-QR
A: Okay that was not the right one.	B-NSTO
K: We think it's because...	I-NSTO
A: That’s too much. Oh. Oh	B-DO
K: Oh god. ha ha ha	B-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Okay that’s what (?), okay, oh my. Um.	B-OO
G: Four times.	B-ATV
K: Oh god.	B-OO
A: None of this ever happens. (?). (?) thing	I-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
A: Put it in. Um. Banana, another banana, the yellow ball can go there. Okay	I-OO
K: Okay, that net, oh (?) put that up.	I-OO
G: Can I have our robot please? Thank you. I got it.	I-OO
A: Here, that’s all set, just put the fishes back to normal. Where’s Eve?	I-OO
K: Eve is over there, she’s (?). Georgie’s programming her.	I-OO
G: I'm coming, I had to program her so that she can get back to base.	B-ATO
A: She just did quite a bit destruction.	B-NSTO
G: What did she do?	B-OO
K: Yeah she did, she made (?).	B-NSTO
G: She made this flip over.	B-DO
K: And then she destroyed that,	I-DO
G: Okay	B-OO
K: She got this out and all of the fish.	B-DO
G: Er which one is it? Oh.  Oh yes.	B-QR
A: It was funny.	B-OO
G: It's programmed. Okay, okay.	I-OO
A: It still needs to go one more over.	B-DO
K: Okay, okay, oh okay.  Oh that, that, it's not working.	B-NSTO
T: It's just doing something different maybe then you had planned. That was amazing.	O
K: At least it got the corn out of the way and, okay.	B-DO
T: Yeah yeah yeah (?)	O
G: So I think it needs to go one more this way to be able to knock this down.	B-DO
A: That’s what I thought.	I-DO
G: Well lets try it again but lets move it over (?).	B-A
A: Where did the bacteria just go?	B-OO
T: (started) (?)	O
K: (?)	O
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
A: It's okay.	I-OO
20:00 G: Yeah it needs to go one more.	B-DO
T: Ooh you got all four pieces (of that).	O
A: ah ha	B-OO
G: Right I need to figure out how to get back to here.	B-A
K: Let me try something.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
T: (?) just come in and (?).	O
K: (So you decided to do that)	B-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Yeah goes... hang on, there.	I-OO
G: Okay so.	I-OO
A: Yeah	I-OO
K: Okay so what we can do is (?) to come back	B-A
A: It's all set back up so...	B-OO
G: We turn it around (?). It (?) things everytime.	B-ATO
A: That’s why we need a control thing, we need to figure out what we’re, for the (?).	I-ATO
G: We don’t have, we cant have it exactly on the edge, we have to have it closer so...	B-A
A: Hold on, can I go just play with it over there and try and find like the perfect spot?	I-A
K: Yeah sure, try.	B-OO
G: Hold on. We can work on this figuring it out (?).	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
G: Let me go and help (?).	I-OO
K: I think I can do that.	I-OO
A: One...	I-OO
G: Andi  I have an idea. So it doesn’t work exactly good if it's exactly on the edge, it works best...	B-A
A: So lets align the wheel with...here or do you wanna do half and half way?	I-A
G: Half way. Might be best.	I-A
A: So half way wheel and then the plough will go...	I-A
G: Two.	I-A
A: Two.	I-A
G: Okay ready?	B-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
Ast: This...	O
A: Okay. You have enough (?).	B-NSTO
G: Oh no it's (?).	I-NSTO
K: Okay.	B-OO
G: Okay it's (?) that’s good, so you didn’t break anything, wait a sec.	B-NSTO
A: Okay	B-OO
G: So let’s have this at one like that.	B-A
A: Okay now you gotta perfect it.	B-NSTO
T: That was good (?) knocked off four pieces of corn.	O
G: I like (?) okay so...	B-OO
A: I think we moved the baby fishy.	B-DO
K: ...maybe we can go like that.	B-OO
G: Okay lets try it so...	I-OO
K: (?).	O
G: (?)	O
A: Don’t we lose points if we hit the baby fishy...	B-OO
K: Is it down button?	B-SO
G: Yeah (?)	B-OO
A: Wait, let me see Eve again we have an issue.	I-OO
G: We’re downloading something.	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
Ast: Do you want me to show you a trick? A trick so you can see everything in one screen?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
Ast: (Okay you figured it out).	O
G: (And then) the arrows.	B-SO
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
A: That’s okay.	I-OO
G: So it can flip back up?	B-DO
A: Okay I think we should do...where did we go last time one?	B-A
G: One.	I-A
A: Lets try half.	I-A
G: Half? And let’s move it over a (tenth). (Right) a line here, see if that works.	I-A
A: Okay. Too much, too much.	B-DO
G: Look it. So because we added five up to here now (?). Okay ready? (?).	B-ATV
A: The fish, those are the only things we’re really concerned about. The ball and fish. Oh, oh, oh, oh... Eve we’re not...	B-A
G: That  didn’t work.	B-NSTO
A: Here can I try one more spot?	B-A
G: Okay. Excuse me that didn’t work exactly.	B-NSTO
K: Okay so what do you think, whether...	B-ATO
G: This one.	I-ATO
K: Hmm.	B-OO
G: We need to have it the other way.	B-ATO
K: Oh the other way?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Okay so maybe I can try that. Can you bring me Eve please?	I-OO
G: Not right now we’re busy.	I-OO
T: Do we get points for knocking carrots down?	O
G: I’ll see.	B-OO
DBF: How did you guys make that kind of plough thing for it?	O
A: Er just a lot of trial and error.	B-D
DBF: Oh cool.	O
A: And we kind of just (?) that worked.	B-D
DBF: Cool, oh so it's like a bunch of (?), I thought you had like a solid piece or something?	O
A: No we just connected some long pieces to make it.	B-D
K: No  (?).	B-OO
A: I'm gonna try three, three.	B-A
K: Oh no, no, no (?).	B-OO
A: Oh my god. Huh.	B-NSTO
K: Maybe that’s the problem.	B-OO
A: Okay, a few	I-OO
G: (?) something else to try while we’re fixing programing.	I-OO
K: Okay. Oh gosh. Should I download it?	I-OO
G: Yeah	I-OO
M: How’s it going over here?	O
A: Alright.	B-OO
M: (?) mission.	O
A: Um. Well we’re trying to do the ball.	B-OO
M: So you’re doing the (?).	O
A: We’re doing this fish.	B-OO
M: Yeah.	O
A: Um. And we’re trying to get corn in the ball.	B-OO
M: (?)	O
A: But we also keep hitting that.	B-OO
G: If you get it back to the base and then that probably counts.	I-OO
A: That’s really good.	I-OO
M: So I talked to one team before about trying to put a whole bunch of missions in one program, can you see why that might be a problem?	O
DBF: If one of them mess’s up then all of them suffers.	O
M: Right, right so you may wanna, you know one or two I think works if you start to do three, four, five then if you get tripped up somewhere along the way.	O
DBF: So you want to have it go back to the base so you can start a new one?	O
M: Yeah have it go back to base and then start a new (?) with a different name.	O
K: How do you guys get it to back up?	B-ATO
M: With a different name.	O
DBF: We just made it er. Go in reverse.	O
M: Yeah.	O
M: Yeah instead of like this (?). Like the default is (?) (?) negative fifty for like (?) I think maybe the (?).	O
K: Oh thanks.	B-OO
A: We need to work on programming	I-OO
G: I'm trying a different one.	I-OO
A: Trying, okay.	I-OO
G: Yeah. So...	I-OO
K: Here. Let me try to experiment.	I-OO
G: So if we do this.	I-OO
K: Can I experiment?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: See what it can do?	I-OO
G: Yeah	I-OO
K: Like like that?	I-OO
G: Yeah. Yeah.	I-OO
K: Oh focusing on, oh gosh.	B-NSTO
G: So we have it go backwards, four	B-ATV
K: Okay so...	B-OO
G: And then have it turn left?	B-ATO
K: Wait a minute, I think I can do something with this, I think I can do something with this, try it again, try it again.	B-A
A: Lets try like this?	I-A
K: Yeah try it again.	I-A
G: Okay can I see Eva please?	B-OO
A: Oh it's gonna hit the baby fish.	B-DO
K: Oh dangit. Try to, try (?) it not to do it  (?).	B-A
A: It's gone.	B-OO

A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Then we can put it in.	B-D
A: Oh wait I have an idea.	B-A
K: Stop, stop stop.	B-OO
A: You can go there because (?).	B-D
G: It won’t fit. That’s why I had this on the (axle).	I-D
A: Yeah	B-OO
A: These stupid chords are so much in the way. Or do we want to put it on the bottom?	B-D
G: I like it here.	I-D
K: Okay try it.	B-OO
G: It's (?).	I-OO
A: There we go.	I-OO
G: (?) like peekaboo.	B-D
K: It looks like wall-e now. No it has to be Eve, fine it's wall-e.	B-OO
A: Okay it's plugged in.	I-OO
T: How do you get them to...	O
A: Do you want me to just gonna program it.	B-QS
K: So she’s gonna add in some things.	I-QS
G: So it's on here like this right?	B-A
A: Okay we’ll make a thing, so...	B-D
G: That’s exactly a point but this needs to be...	B-A
MA: I'm just gonna take this board a minute and bring it right back, is that gonna distract you?	O
G: No, no no. Here so that’s the corner of each.	B-A
A: Okay. So that’s our.	I-A
G: Okay. So can you move out the way please?	B-OO
A: Actually it will need to move over (?).	B-A
K: Okay it's working, it's kind of, oh gosh.	B-NSTO
A: No it's working.	I-NSTO
K: It didn’t kill the animals. Yes.	B-OO
G: Well the cow (moved if you look at it).	I-OO
50:00 DBS: Yeah roughly.	O
G: So it backed up here, so then if we have it turn slightly, we have it like turn, it was like this when it backed up, because it hit the truck. So I think...	B-DO
A: Th- this truck is in the way. Yeah we should.	I-DO
G: Lets try this again but lets move it over slightly. More.	B-A
A: So	B-OO
G: Okay? Here we go.	I-OO
K: We moved the fish.	B-DO
A: No you didn’t.	I-DO
K: Oh	B-OO
A: Yeah, no, you know. Try out this (?).	B-NSTO
G: What if we try and go for the yellow one first?	B-A
K: Yeah what is, if that, that might work.	B-OO
G: Angle it differently like this.	B-A
A: Go ahea-	B-OO
G: Lets try this. Oh...	I-OO
MA: That (?) be there. Ta da. Do I get points for that?	O
G: So I'm just gonna put everything backwards then.	B-ATO
A: So we have something.	B-OO
G: If we’re gonna do that instead so I have to make this one...	B-ATO
A: Also we got to do lighting, got to fix that, because that’s a big one.	B-A
G: Where is lighting? Display, sound, what’s this one?	B-QS
A: (?) status light.	I-QS
K: I'm trying to program.	B-OO
A: (?)	I-OO
G: What color?	B-QS
K: We should do it purple.	I-QS
G: Lets do it green.	I-QS
A: Green.	I-QS
K: No I want it purple.	I-QS
A: Er true.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: What colors are there?	B-QS
A: Lets try it.	B-OO
T: What are you guys doing?	O
K: We’re doing the.	B-OO
A: Here plug this in, give me the robot thingy to measure.	B-A
G: Yeah yeah. And then that one’s gonna be right now, so like this one...	B-ATO
K: Here I can, I can try it come on.	B-OO
G: It's gonna back up.	B-ATO
K: No we have (?).	B-OO
G: So the light will go on and it will go forward it’ll come backward and turn right, it’ll go forward and come backwards.	B-ATO
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
G: So that’s good.	I-OO
G: Do you want it to be a full right turn or do we want to have a slightly u-turn? U-turn or right?	B-ATO
A: Right there.	I-ATO
G: Here, okay so...	B-OO
K: Can I go and get like get something like (?).	I-OO
T: (Can you what)	O
K: Can I go and get like a little break?	B-OO
T: Yeah what do you want to do (?) out there (?)	O
K: No I just wanna sit down for a second.	B-OO
T: Okay you can sit down out there.	O
K: Okay. (?)	B-OO
A: Try it again, wait is it at A? (Brick) status, light. Oh hold on.	B-QS
G: Wait a minute, go back into here for a sec.	I-QS
A: Oh I forgot it was touch screen.	I-QS
G: So then...what does A attach to? That.	B-QR
A: Oh sugar.	B-OO
G: You’re gonna have to reattach.	B-QR
A: Okay I’ll do that. Feel so sorry for whoever’s been listening to me for this past hour.  You must have a wonderful job.	B-OO
G: I'm sorry that you had to listen to us complain about how it's not working.	I-OO
A: Yes, yes.	I-OO
G: Terribly sorry.	I-OO
A: Sorry. Oh my god what are you doin?	I-OO
G: I'm trying something.	I-OO
A: Oh okay.	I-OO
G: Oh Oh Oh... Woah, they’re red, they’re glowing.	B-D
A: Lets try yellow, yellow.	B-ATV
G: No still red. ‘cause it's on two. Still red, still red.	I-ATV
A: Yellow. It's close enough, here I’ll attach it, I got it.	I-ATV
G: Okay you attach that, oh wait got it.	B-D
A: Okay we got (?).	B-OO
G: One minute, can you move your hand for a second?	I-OO
A: Yeah I just gotta... (move) some stuff.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
A: Let’s do this. Program...	I-OO
G: Oh no. What just happened?	I-OO
A: We have to wait until it turns on. Oh no.	I-OO
G: There we go it's lighting up again.	I-OO
A: It's yellow.	I-OO
G: Here.	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: Here...see? Oh	B-OO
G: We weren’t having it that way, we’re having it a (?). I just remembered that.	B-A
A: Oh just let it go. Lets try it over here again?	I-A
T: What’s the number to get a hold of (mom) would it be this number here?	O
A: Um...	B-OO
T: There’s been a little w- we’re gonna be here till four thirty so we wont be back to the school before forty- five, we wont be there until like five fifteen ish.	O
G: I'm need to go get my phone then.	B-OO
T: Okay,	O
A: Um I can just text her.	B-OO
G: No my cousin is gonna be (n- my) mom.	I-OO
T: Okay so (?)	O
A: Yeah because my dad’s gonna be there.	B-OO
T: Yeah, so if you could let them know that we will be there at, so that pushes everything back half hour so say five fifteen, they should meet us at the school at five fifteen.	O
A: Um	B-OO
YTS: Okay where’s your (?).	O
T: You guys would you prefer that I call your parents or do you guys want to call your parents and let them know it's gonna be five fifteen at the school instead of four forty five .	O
YTS: What?	O
T: Five fifteen.	O
YTS: Okay.	O
T: We’re here ‘til four thirty.	O
YTS: Yeah we’ll call our parents.	O
T: Yeah do you want to do that now?	O
YTS:  Yeah can I use this?	O
A: Um no because you have to use like what’s in our kit.	B-OO
YTS: But you have two of them.	O
A: I know we can’t um...wait...	B-OO
T: (?) extra kits they could loan pieces but make sure you guys call your parents.	O
A: What? no, we can (ask the lady).	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
K: Sorry just took a little break. So what are we working on right now?	B-OO
A: We’re working a lot.	I-OO
K: So how far did you get it?	I-OO
A: Okay. We don’t want it right.	I-OO
G: Yeah no we want (?)	I-OO
K: Wait, wait, wait guys, guys...	I-OO
A: ...here.	I-OO
G: Wait	I-OO
A: (?) my finger.	I-OO
G: Forwards backwards, no we need a right but... We need it almost a u-turn. Not three sixty but like a u-turn so then it’ll turn around.	B-ATO
A: Forward we want that to be more left right?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Yeah I got it. So do... Three.	B-ATV
G: Not like that, like that,	B-ATO
A: There. Erm.	B-OO
G: And then we need this one forward again, right?	B-ATO
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: And then we need another one for backwards.	B-ATO
G: Oh yeah. It it, is it plugged in?	B-QR
A: How do you download?	B-QS
G: Is it plugged in?	B-QR
A: Yeah. How do you download?	B-QS
G: (?).	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
K: Okay let’s try this.	I-OO
G: Hey guys there’s another station over there (?).	I-OO
K: Yeah let’s go.	I-OO
G: Something looks different.	I-OO
K: No it's not.	I-OO
G: It looks different though.	I-OO
K: It kind of does but not really, it's not different.	I-OO
A: It, it... hhhh	I-OO
G: That one’s a bit darker.	I-OO
A: I saw that. Oh, oh, oh, oh no fine...okay, no we don’t want that forward.	B-DO
G: We need it backwards all the way.	I-DO
A: Where did that other piece of corn go?	B-OO
G: Need backwards and then we need it to turn. Excuse me.	B-DO
A: Yeah okay.	B-OO
G: (?).	I-OO
M: This is partly a camera reset and it's partly me remembering what I was gonna tell you. I told some teams separately but I want to tell you altogether, when you’re writing a program and it has a bunch of different missions in it, what happens if your program gets hung up, your robot gets hung up on that first mission? (?) rest of the mission, so try to write a separate program for each mission that you’re doing, maybe you can put two in there if it seems like it's gonna be a (?).	I-OO
K: (When can I do what we can do)	I-OO
M: (?)	O
K: We can do it	B-OO
M: Is everybody set to go, okay, back to work.	O
A: Lets do this. Everything’s reset I think. Go.	B-OO
G: Go, go, go, noooo. Okay so lets see your problem.	B-NSTO
A: Well did you fix it?	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Oh god.	I-OO
K: Why oh my gosh.	I-OO
G: Oops.	I-OO
A: huh huh	I-OO
G: Oops. Okay then.	I-OO
A: (?) broke it.	I-OO
G: I didn’t break it, you broke it here.	I-OO
A: This lego came out. Put the corn thingy bob...	I-OO
MT: (?).	O
G: What?	B-OO
MT: Do you mind if you I (record this	O
G: Not at all it's probably gonna fail anyway. Exactly.	B-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha	I-OO
G: That didn’t work correctly.	B-NSTO
K: Okay that was very distructive.	I-NSTO
FT: Did you guys already go out in front of the judges?	O
G: Not yet.	B-OO
K: Oh no.	I-OO
FT: Okay we’ll try and (?).	O
K: That’s really cool that, like (?) cell phone have like slow motion	B-OO
G: My ipad has um	I-OO
MT: You’re gonna see it blow up in slow motion, it's very slow.	O
K: That’s fine.	B-OO
MT: Here it comes.	O
K: That’s so weird.	B-OO
MT: Boom.	O
K: Hmm, maybe we can focus on the angle a bit more.	B-A
G: Yeah no I just angled it wrong. Oh angled that wrong too.	I-A
K: Oh my god.	B-NSTO
G: Oh god.	I-NSTO
MT: <laughing>	O
K: Eve is evil.	B-OO
MT: (Call it a twister)	O
K: No her name is Eve you know from Wally, the one who blows up everything.	B-OO
G: Oh no, (they changed this yellow car)	I-OO
K: We killed a lot of things.	I-OO
G: Oh my gosh	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh.	I-OO
K: The cow, you know that cow died.	I-OO
G: (?) not get hurt, but oh my gosh this thing isn’t broken. You have to put it on the Velcro.  Okay lets try this again.	I-OO
K: Here try Eve right like...	B-A
G: There.	B-OO
K: Eve is evil, oh my gosh, the cow’s head fell off, no.	I-OO
G: It did	I-OO
A: So two and a half and five and a half.	B-A
G: No...	B-OO
K: Did you see what, what that looked like.	I-OO
G: It looked like motion sickness.	I-OO
T: Andi (?) told your mum	O
A: Um I d-	B-OO
G: I texted my cousin.	I-OO
A: Probably working right now.	I-OO
T: I set it for five fifteen?	O
A: Yeah he’s probably working right now, so.	B-OO
G: (Georgie) you do know your name tag’s upside down.	I-OO
G <laughing>	O
T: Do you want that? Did you do that on purpose or...	O
G: I don’t know.	B-OO
T: Okay um so, your mum’s coming here at three thirty five?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
T: Okay, so initially I thought we ended at four but we end at four thirty, so I left a message for her just letting her know that we’ll be here.	O
A: (Not working) okay, stop.	B-NSTO
K: This is how the cow looks like now.	B-OO
G: That worked great until the end, I think I’ll program that better.	B-NSTO
A: So we should do that, just fix the end.	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Do you remember what angle you had?	B-A
G: Nope.	B-OO
A: Oh my god we’re gonna die, just fix the end and we’ll figure it out. Wait you forgot to download, oh...	B-A
G: There we go.	B-OO
: (?).	O
G: (?) you did a cow.	B-OO
A: Oh it's...	I-OO
G: Oh my god it's... (?) it's fixed it. We kind of broke it.	I-OO
K: It's how it is now.	I-OO
G: What did you do to the cow?	I-OO
K: It, it's how it is.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
G: (?), I got it.	B-OO
A: Oh, oh it's beautiful huh?	I-OO
DGS: To me it turned too much.	O
DGP: Yeah.	O
DGA: Yeah.	O
A: Oh my god you idiot.	B-OO
K: It's not my fault that it decided to not, not listen to me.	I-OO
DGS: Lets turn this one off. So we need to go in.	O
DGP: So how much gonna go (?).	O
DGS: Okay, I think we need to go up to here right and then if you just move it like that and (?). It wont move that much.	O
DG: (?).	O
<general classroom noise>	O
G:  (?) just make it so that it swerves all over the table destroying everything	B-A
K: Wait wait wait don’t do it yet. I’m going g- video	B-OO
G: It's close enough really. To tell you the truth I feel bad for this car right now. Well...we’re still...oh here’s the blue one. So lets try this again.	I-OO
T: Oh where did this come from?	O
K: Oh we broke it.	B-OO
G: (?).	O
A: Another thing.	B-OO

A: So come to me	B-OO
K: Er straight move. Straight move or curved move?	B-ATO
A: Do straight. The one.	I-ATO
K: One?	B-OO
A: Sure	I-OO
K: Oh that’s backwards	B-DO
A: Yeah that’s	I-DO
K: Okay stop. Let’s do two. Stop.	B-QR
A: That’s the right way it’s just, you have it backwards.	B-DO
K: Oh. Okay. Okay.	B-OO
A: Then it comes back.	B-DO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
A: Go back	B-DO
K: Let me try this again.	B-OO
T: Cool.	I-OO
A: Oh	I-OO
K: Alright. Let’s try one see what happens.	B-QR
A: Can we unplug this for now?	I-QR
K: Yeah I think we can.	I-QR
G: No. I’m programming it. I haven't programmed it yet.	B-OO
K: (Oh can I have a go at programming)	I-OO
G: I huh uh	I-OO
A: She’s just doing the thing	I-OO
K: I have an idea maybe I should work on a plough	B-D
A: Plough. We should use this.	I-D
K: Should we wanna start with,	B-OO
G: (?)	O
K: (?)	O
A: Okay let’s just check this thing. No.	B-A
G: We wanna start with um.	B-OO
K: I don’t really wanna start with the bacteria because it’s a bit too tricky	B-A
G: E: um. Pushing the balls off that one.	I-A
K: The ba- ba-	B-OO
A: Yeah let's try that.	I-OO
G: Um I think we should use something like this. See this.	B-D
K: Hm mm	B-OO
G: And we can	I-OO
A: I was thinking we could just make our plough like this and just keep adding more and more	B-D
G: Go ahead and do whatever you guys think I’m gonna go look at the table and then I’m gonna (start) (?) programming	B-OO
K: She’s the programmer we’re the builders. Okay.	I-OO
A: I’ll try and make a plough.	I-OO
K: We (need to make a) (?) like this or this	B-D
A: Oh let’s try this. These.	I-D
K: Okay I have a feeling maybe we can like go like this, and this can go like that	I-D
A: The problem is attaching them.	I-D
G: And I’m adding a sensor	I-D
A: Hold on let me try.	B-OO
K: (To add a sensor we need a sensor). It would be really awesome if we could do it by um the voice commands.	B-D
A: Uh th- th- that’s not gonna happen.	B-OO
K: We can probably make it happen.	B-D
G: Where’s the sensor?	I-D
A: Not in the time we have.	B-OO
G: It’s not over here.	B-D
G: Where’s the sensor?	I-D
K: The the sensor is that.	I-D
G: I found it.	I-D
K: Oh shall I put it in?	I-D
G: No I got it.	I-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
G: So which way do we want it to go do we want it forward. Mostly? If we do then we need. Okay can I have one of those cords.	B-QR
K: L- let’s get the short one.	B-D
G: Okay so attach.	I-D
A: I’m gonna be making a plough by the way,	I-D
G: This	I-D
K: Okay start making a plough I’m gonna work on maybe a claw?	I-D
A: Go ahead. I have a plough idea.	I-D
G: A what?	B-OO
K: A claw	B-D
G: Okay you try and make that I don’t know how you’re gonna do that but okay.	B-OO
K: Can I have a pegolian?	B-D
A: I don’t know what that is but okay	B-OO
K: Pegolian is the blue pegs. Thank you.	B-D
A: There so. I’ll just keep building like this. To make a plough.	I-D
K: Okay this is actually um I think I know what I’m doing. Look. This will be the handle. (You) (?) (should test). Like if it can go straight.	I-D
G: We will test. Just right now we're not gonna program.	B-A
T: Schedule for today, so we’ve got...	O
K: Oh oh	B-OO
T: ... lunch twelve to twelve thirty and then team building	I-OO
K: Miss Palmer is this a good um crane. Idea.	B-D
T: It looks pretty cool	O
G: But how will we get it to move, that’s the only thing.	B-QR
A: We’ll figure it out.	B-OO
T: Did you decide what mission you wanna do?	O
G: We first wanted to do I think we should do	B-OO
A: Everything.	I-OO
G: Push the balls off (?)	B-AE
K: Yeah	B-OO
T: Okay	I-OO
G: That sort of thing.	I-OO
T: (?)	O
G: We’re making a plough we’re also adding a sensor, so it can sense it and then lightly push it off without destroying anything else.	B-A
T: Okay	O
G: So I need	B-D
A: So it can fastly  get over there but then lightly push it off	B-A
K: And I’m making um er like a crane to (gather) like the I dunno the corn. Possibly.	B-D
A: We’ll just hit the thing so the corn comes off. We can also probably push it. Cos hold on. Let me go check something out cos I think we can just push it. We can just push it.	B-A
G: .hh huh (we can just push it.) (?)	I-A
A: So this is like a plough I guess.	B-D
K: Er	B-OO
A: Then we’ll like fix it (around)	B-D
K: Yeah that’s that’s that’s good	I-D
G: ...this is going in A?	I-D
?: (?) place, drop fully showing the low red temperatures(?).	O
A: I am super good at programming.	B-OO
?: Which one is that that’s the	O
A: (?)	B-OO
?: That’s the one	O
G: (?)	B-OO
K: Mm	I-OO
?: Er	O
K: Yeah you are	B-OO
? Um (?)	O
A: Okay.	B-OO
K: I think I have a piece,	I-OO
T: (?)	O
K: Is gum allowed?	B-OO
A: Okay all you have to do is push it really.	B-A
G: (?)	O
K: I’ll ask her	B-OO
G: What do you think of the sensor that I made?	B-D
K: I, I have a question.	B-OO
A: I think it will work.	B-D
K: I have a question, is gum allowed?	B-OO
A: It’s awful. No I'm just kidding it's pretty good.	B-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: Are we gonna put another on the other side?	B-D
K: They say it is, they say it is. So I’ll go get some for all of us.	B-OO
G: So...	I-OO
K: I’ll be right back.	I-OO
A: Alright.	I-OO
T: Where are you going?	O
K: I get my, get some gum.	B-OO
T: Okay where’s (?) in your jacket?.	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: How many, I'm gonna see how many rotations it takes.	B-ATV
A: Oh this will rotate so...	B-D
G: To go one around.	B-ATV
A: Are we putting this in the front or the back?	B-D
G: The front.	I-D
A: Okay so I'm gonna need to look at that and figure...	I-D
G: Right.	B-OO
A: ...out I'm gonna...	B-D
G: Particularly on that back like that (?) you add some things like a hook.	I-D
A: Huh.	B-OO
G: To be able to do that when we pull the white trailer.	B-A
T: You got two, two. Do you want one Aurelie?	O
A: Oh sure. Thank you.	B-OO
T: Yeah	O
A: Oh,  I am (?). Because this is all gonna be changed in the front.	B-D
K: I didn’t know if you wanted gum or not	B-OO
A: Thank you.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: What flavor is it?	I-OO
K: Orange.	I-OO
A: This is difficult. Building a plough. (?)	B-D
K: Okay so I'm making the other...I'm (?) pretty much (?)	I-D
G: (?)	O
G: Base and how much one rot- how far one rotation will give us.	B-ATV
A: Okay.	B-OO
G: Well lets see...	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
K: (Excuse me)	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: They’re not having the thing I'm looking for.	B-D
K: What are you looking for?	I-D
A: I know it when I see it.	I-D
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: We’re gonna end up having for the claw we’re gonna have to have something with gears.	B-D
G: There we go.	B-OO
A: So I was thinking something like this.	B-D
G: Okay I'm gonna see how much longer rotation will take us on the (base).	B-ATV
A: Okay, alright.	B-OO
K: Okay	I-OO
A: Gonna end up having to do a lot more than I wanted.	B-D
K: Oh well.	B-OO
A: No I mean just a lot more things on it.	B-D
K: Hmm.	B-OO
A: Want it to be more simple but I cant (?) wanna take the whole thing apart.	B-D
K: I don’t think you.	B-OO
A: Exactly.	I-OO
K: That works.	B-D
A: At last.	I-D
G: Great.	B-NSTO
K: Did it fall?	B-DO
G: It didn’t move.	I-DO
K: Oh. Hey can I try something on that, can I try something please? Can I try something?	B-OO
G: It's not moving forward.	B-DO
A: Yeah it will.	I-DO
G: How did we do that before?	B-QS
A: We clicked forward and it went.	B-QR
K: Here let me try. Can I?	B-OO
A: Go ahead.	I-OO
K: Can I?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Wait, what? oh I'm programing (on) this.	I-OO
K: Oh my god.	I-OO
A: Because we figured out another way to make it move forward.	B-ATO
A: Come on I need this thing.	B-D
K: We need the car to be more stable.	I-D
G: It moved backwards?	B-DO
K: It moved forwards.	I-DO
G: Oh that’s forwards, so I have an idea.	I-DO
A: Oh I got it, I got it, I got it, that’s much better, no that’s not better at all, oh hold on, hold on.	B-D
G: Hey go ahead and do what you’re doing. (?).	B-OO
K: What do you want?	I-OO
G: S- wait I have gum, I aren’t supposed to have gum.	I-OO
K: Oh your braces.	I-OO
G: But I'm chewing it anyway, because I'm hungry.	I-OO
A: Oh it needs to be a bit more stable. Of course hold on, hold on I've got it, I figured out how to program (?) like a plough.	B-D
K: Not as stable as I hoped but good enough.	I-D
A: Go, go, go. There you go. I made a plough, I just got to attach it, which I'm going to do right now.	I-D
G: Okay so...	B-OO
A: Hold on.	I-OO
G: Hmm.	I-OO
K: I made a sort of plough.	B-D
G: (?)	O
A: (And it) works huh huh huh	B-D
K: Can this work?	I-D
G: (?)	O
K: It's like a picker upper thing.	B-D
G: We can do that, oh there’s one for groceries, do we have to lift it onto the table, how do we do that? Wait a minute...	B-A
K: .hhhh	B-OO
G: (?)	O
K: I'm trying to figure something out.	B-OO
A: Wait, did you guys figure something out?	I-OO
K: I'm figuring something out.	I-OO
G: Are you going to (clap)?	B-D
A: Almost I just troubleshooted something.	I-D
K: And I, it's not exactly a claw but it's kind of like it.	I-D
G: I need to test something.	B-OO
A: Can you give me a minute?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Because I just figured out how to make this plough.	B-D
K: We gotta make sure that the plough is retractable.	I-D
A: Oh darn.	B-OO
G: What do you mean retractable	B-D
K: Well it can go up and back, it's kind of like a, let me show you.	I-D
A: Okay, well that’s your plough so far, I'm gonna you know make it like more ploughy but.	I-D
K: It's kind of like this, it can like push it and maybe like when, while we’re and then it can go like...	B-A
A: It's over...there.	I-A
K: Yeah like that, can I, can I do something (?) program?	B-OO
G: Hold on we’re testing one rotation.	B-ATV
K: Oh my god.	B-OO
G: Just to see how far it’ll go, that’s, that’s one more rotation.	B-ATV
K: That’s one, one rotation.	I-ATV
G: And that’s the program.	B-DO
K: That’s, that’s a little bit too far.	I-DO
A: If we can have it, turn	B-ATO
K: No one rotation’s right there,	B-ATV
A: From over here...	B-A
G: Yeah I know I’m in the	I-A
A: (Don’t.)	B-OO
G: So one rotation will take us to here from...	B-ATV
K: Oh okay, okay I get it okay so let’s try this.	B-OO
G: so (?) right here.	B-DO
K: Okay lets try, lets try.	B-OO
G: Here.	B-A
K: One rotation.	B-ATV
A: Then for this all we need...	B-A
K: No (?).	B-OO
G: (?)	I-OO
A: No it's not supposed to go there, oh no.	B-DO
K: (It fell) Here I know where it goes.	B-D
A: Wait where did that chord come from? Oh it's supposed to be like that.	I-D
K: I kind of made like a little tiny plough in like.	I-D
A: Where was that?	I-D
10:00 G: One two	B-ATV
A: (Three)	I-ATV
G: (That wasn’t it).	B-DO
K: (?)	O
G: (That’s too far).	B-DO
A: Yeah that’s too far.	I-DO
A: So one base takes us to this intersection.	B-ATV
G: Two, three.	I-ATV
A: Three.	I-ATV
G: The fish, the fish.	B-A
K: Yeah we can do it like that.	I-A
G: Four.	B-ATV
K: It's on the mat. We got to do something about it, maybe we can like (?).	B-DO
K: (Here) (?) program a bit?	B-OO
A: Here can I see the (?).	I-OO
G: I just want to just finish this one and download it and then you can do a different project one.	I-OO
K: Huh, huh.	I-OO
G: Don’t touch it yet please,	I-OO
A: Who	I-OO
G: I wanna make sure we get the one onto this one.	I-OO
K: Oh my (cord)	I-OO
G: Guys we don’t want to add anything to the side because it will make it too long.	B-D
K: Oh yeah that’s right.	B-OO
A: I'm not going past the tire hopefully.	B-D
K: Okay. No you’re not you’re fine.	I-D
T: So this is like the top of it you guys have built?	O
A: Yeah we’re building it.	B-D
K: Oh.	B-OO
A: I have an idea.	B-D
K: We need it to go faster.	B-ATV
G: I can’t make it go faster.	I-ATV
T: (You can) there is a programming thing for speed	O
K: One day you can h-, oh my gosh.	B-OO
G: (?) I think that’s what. What is (?).	O
K: Oh yeah, yeah there’s a clock thing right there (?).	B-QS
G: (?) that’s power. Hold on what does this say?	I-QS
K: (Maybe) more power equals more speed.	B-ATV
T: Okay so this is number of rotations, so if you want it to go a certain distance you can count rotations.	O
A: Oh, not having what I want.	B-D
G: Okay let’s...	B-OO
T: What is this, try this one, what does it say?	O
G: Oh my gosh it's a touch screen.	B-OO
A: What?	I-OO
T: That’s cool.	O
G: It turns it and...	B-ATO
T: So that’s the turning okay, so that changes direction, so maybe this is...	O
K: Yeah boom, we got this.	B-OO
T: (?) like if you change that number the eighty seven does that make it go slower?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Just try it, try it.	I-OO
A: Come back here.	B-DO
K: Yeah.	B-OO
T: Is that slower?	O
K: That speed right there.	B-ATV
T: Okay.	O
K: What if these (?) all these different places.	B-QS
G: Medium motor, large motor, motor settings stuff like that.	I-QS
T: Okay. Alright	O
K: Georgie. Maybe we can download voice, voice control.	B-ATO
A: Oh, oh, oh come here oh come here.	B-OO
K: Okay can I, can I work on this for a minute.	I-OO
G: As soon as I download it on here.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Well the only thing is we can’t (?) I don’t think we need this actually.	B-D
K: Why don’t we need the sensors?	I-D
G: Because it just adds too much like to the sides.	I-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: We could change where the sensors position is? Yeah I think it could go right here.	B-D
K: Maybe you know like in the front and...	I-D
A: Goes on...	I-D
K: Why am I so uncomfortable wearing these microphones they’re huge.	B-OO
A: Oh my god I forgot I have one, thanks for reminding me.	I-OO
K: Georgie can I start programming?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: I really want to use touchscreen.	I-OO
A: Okay um thanks for reminding me.	I-OO
K: What haven’t we what haven’t we been working on?	I-OO
A: Everything.	I-OO
K: No what haven’t we been working on? Oh no, no didn’t really do that.	I-OO
A: Sensor can stay away, I'm still building a plough.	B-D
K: Thish, wait... mm:::: Project. Hold this for me? Hold it for me please? Please?	B-OO
K: (Color) sensor, touch sensor, temperature sensor.	B-QS
G: Did anyone see a miniature rubber band anywhere?	B-OO
A: Nope?	I-OO
T: Is this like for you hair?	O
G: No.	B-OO
T: Was it part of the kit?	O
G: No.	B-OO
T: Oh it was part of that	O
G: No	B-OO
T: Oh what colour is it?	O
G: Tan.	B-OO

G: They’re all in our kits.	B-OO
DBS: Yeah but...	O
DBF: Yeah but we’re not using them Sarah so (?).	O
<classroom chatter>	O
A: What is she doing?	B-NSTO
T: (If it) knocks them out little by little.	O
A: Oh my god Eve, Eve, Eve.	B-NSTO
<laughing>	O
G: Fail, fail, we failed again.	B-NSTO
A: Hold on let me see, I got it. So	B-OO
K: What’s the problem here, where is the problem?	B-A
A: Everywhere, nothing is angling right.	I-A
K: Maybe we should not do it on an angle?	I-A
A: We’re not having an angle, hold on.  So forward... I got it.	I-A
G: (?).	O
A: Forward, that’s fine.	B-ATO
K: What are we doing backwards, forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards...	I-ATO
A: Yeah, this...(there’s forward) though.	I-ATO
K: Needs to be at...this other angle. Okay so back, forward...	I-ATO
M: You wanna hear this (?) it's time for a snack break, so there is one cookie per person until everybody has had one and then there, (?) go through the line again. We set up on the table out there and we take a little five minute break, have a snack then go back through, don’t forget to give your microphones (?) bathroom, okay?	O
K: So (?).	B-OO
G: Andi guess what happened?	I-OO
A: What?	I-OO
G: I angled it, it managed to knock two of these out...	B-DO
A: Huh, uh.	B-OO
G: But then it also came back to the base.	B-DO
K: Oh okay,	B-OO
G: So we’ll figure something out.	I-OO
K: So okay Georgie okay, Andi, can I call you Andi?	I-OO
A: Close enough yeah.	I-OO
K: (?) go right and knock this out, out of the way possibly get that back over here (?). I think I have a plan.	B-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: Oh my god you’re so focused in this and you’re not even like okay, aha okay, sure.	I-OO
G: I feel like I need a ton of sugar	I-OO
T: Yeah	O
G: And then go and run (?) for a few minutes.	B-OO
R: Hi everybody.	O
K: Oh can we get an oreo?	B-OO
R: (?) get back on the other side of the line, because there is a line going there.	O
K: Okay, I, I have to go program more. Yeah. I’ll be right back.	O
M: Yeah just make sure there’s enough for everybody, take one cookie	O
A: Are you? Is Georgie taking a break?	B-OO
K: Um she’s taking, here...	I-OO
A: Okay, (?)	I-OO
K: (?)	I-OO
A: Let’s try (?) this.	B-A
K: (?) try to see and maybe, maybe it might work if it doesn’t I have an idea.	I-A
A: I think it just needs tweaking, because this is just like a rough estimate currently.	I-A
K: Okay Okay.  After this (?) we can go get some cookies, (Second one)	B-OO
?: (Just a cut).	O
A: No. I’m good working.	B-OO
K: Ooh look at this.	I-OO
A: That one, that one doesn’t work on our robot.	I-OO
K: Is that how you like separate it?	I-OO
A: Um can I...	I-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
G: No, it just slides off.	B-D
?: No, what is...	O
G: Nothing, just to hold the case together.	B-D
?: Cool.	O
G: So how is you guys coming along?	B-OO
K: Right there	I-OO
? : Very badly.	O
G: Same here.	B-OO
A: Right there, she’s there.	I-OO
K: Ready?	O
A: Back up, up, up one more.	B-DO
?: Yeah me and her (?).	O
A: Oops that’s the wrong one.	B-OO
K: Which one, which one is it?	I-OO
WT: Are you gonna keep programming?	O
K: Yeah we’ll probably get one (done) later.	B-OO
A: Which way are they going? She’s already there.	B-NSTO
K: Program.	B-OO
A: Oh...	I-OO
G: My group already too their coffee break.	I-OO
A: Wait, wait, wait, there she goes, there...so close.	B-NSTO
G: And water	B-OO
A: Okay, okay, okay we can do this.	I-OO
K: Do you want me to go and get you a cookie?	I-OO
A: No.	I-OO
K: You sure?	I-OO
A: Yeah I’m good.	I-OO
K: I’ll be right back.	I-OO
A: I am perfectly fine working. So...	I-OO
?: (?) from Georgie’s (?). They let her do all the work.	O
?: (?) smarter (?)	O
?: (?) yeah you are.	O
?: (just because she’s smarter than you you shouldn’t) take advantage of it.	O
K: Okay. Andi is really good at it,	B-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: She made a program up that can both knock out the bacteria, get the ball out of the way, um turn around a bit without destructing anything and get the yellow one.	B-A
G: It worked twice.	B-OO
K: And she, it was really close, it didn’t break anything, it didn’t (?).	B-A
G: Did it get back to the base?	I-A
K: Yeah it did get back to the base.	I-A
G: Well. Oh no my rubber band.	B-OO
?: Your mum doesn’t look like you.	O
K: A lot of people do, say that I do.	B-OO
?: It’s just your faces for some reason.	O
K: If you say.	B-OO
?: Like your faces don’t look like (?)	O
G: Everyone’s like oh my gosh you and your sister look so much alike, I look at her, I look at me in the mirror and I'm like no we don’t.	B-OO
?: No.	O
A: No I’m good.	B-OO
G: She has curly hair, I don’t, she’s like the same height as me but she likes to wear purple and like dresses.	I-OO
?: I want another muffin.	O
K: Me too.	B-OO
G: I (?) good anymore. I'm gonna go and get another cookie. Are we allowed to get another cookie?	I-OO
K: I got to finish programming.	I-OO
T: Everyone’s been through once, so, I was going to grab a second cookie.	O
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
G: Don’t die. I'm sorry.	I-OO
K: I'm feeling really bad that Sally cant come?	I-OO
G: What happened do you know?	I-OO
K: Well all I know is that she has a lot of doctor appointments.	I-OO
G: What happened to Sally?	I-OO
?: Sally I know she hasn’t been here forever.	O
K: All I know is that she has a lot of doctors appointments. (?) something.	B-OO
?: What if she did, that would just be bad, oh my goodness.	O
K: If she what?	B-OO
?: Had ebola Sally.	O
?: (?)	O
?: You do, she does?	O
?: No. She, she drank the Ebola I reckon so, cos she had to go to a doctor appointment, and when you have to go to a doctor appointment you have to drink ebola.	O
G: Why?	B-OO
K: I don’t know it's just every team has to drink Ebola. I am not getting, I am not getting a doctor’s appointment.	I-OO
?: I have a doctor’s appointment on Tuesday.	O
G: How old are you?	B-OO
?: Twelve.	O
G: Then you can’t have it because you’re not thirteen yet.	B-OO
K: That’s so stupid they try and prevent ebola and they’re just giving you ebola.	I-OO
?: You’re just like.	O
K: I'm done with doctors.	B-OO
G: I have a doctors appointment on the twentieth	I-OO
?: How old are you?	O
G: Thirteen.	B-OO
?: They give it to (?).	O
K: Did you get it?	B-OO
?: No my mum, my mum was gonna take us.	O
A: No. I fixed some things	B-OO
G: It's not exactly a doctor’s appointment I'm getting a camera stuck up my nose and down my throat to see if I have vocal chord (?).	I-OO
K: It doesn’t really exactly need that much (turns).	B-ATO
A: Um well the goal wasn’t that, that wasn’t the goal. (?)	B-A
Okay.	B-OO
G: I am freaking out.	I-OO
?: I would not be able to do that.	O
A: Need to die.	B-OO
K: Do we n-...	I-OO
A: We need to go right	B-ATO
K: What do you mean?	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
A: Let’s try that	B-OO
K: Let’s try (really) want to get this	I-OO
A: She’s all set. (?)	I-OO
K: Oh yeah, can you fix the fish too?	B-A
A: It does not feel like Saturday.	B-OO
K: No. Only because	I-OO
A: Go ahead. Turn, turn, keep going, no keep going.	B-DO
K: Why is it not going?	I-DO
A: I will fix that.	B-OO
K: Let’s restart that, let’s restart that.	I-OO
A: No it's a faulty thing over here. I see. You should have power, you shouldn’t be at zero you should have sixty...it's just a lot of computer work really.	B-ATO
G: What’s your robot’s name? Our’s is Eve for Evil.	B-OO
K: Did you get it?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Okay lets try this.	I-OO
A: Darn it, I have to be over here hold on. Okay she’s all set. There, there, there, oh my god we were so close. What are you doing now? What are you doing?	B-NSTO
G: You may, you may have done a right turn instead of a left one.	B-ATO
A: Yeah that’s, I think...that one’s supposed to go. This top thing is really confusing. Okay I think we can get rid of this one.	B-QS
G: Why?	B-OO
A: Because it already has a backwards one right here.	B-ATO
G: Okay, whatever.	B-OO
G: Oh no.	I-OO
A: There you go.	I-OO
G: Okay let’s download it	I-OO
A: Program.	I-OO
K: It’s like plug her in.	I-OO
A: Oh I need that.	I-OO
K: She’s all set.	I-OO
A: Wait, doesn’t look right, there’s one too many here I think.	B-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: No it's fine, except I don’t know why this says seventy six forward.	B-ATV
G: No that's not seventy six forward that’s just seventy six (?) like the speed.	I-ATV
A: Yeah I know.	B-OO
K: Come on, can somebody download it. It's downloading.	B-QR
A: Try ha-	B-OO
K: I got this, I got this,	I-OO
A: I'm gonna go  use the bathroom okay.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Don’t forget to turn your mic off.	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
G: Only with that one (?).	I-OO
A: I'm just gonna leave it here.	I-OO
G: Katie come and use this one.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Oh nice job, nice job. Nice job.	I-OO
DBA: Wait Fiona where were we at?	O
DBS: We’re about like right here.	O
G: How come, where’s the beach? I wanna go sunbathing. There’s no beach here it's just dirt, there’s no beach I wanna go sunbathing.	B-OO
K: Oh look.	I-OO
G: That’s works beautifully.	I-OO
K: Um can you... Okay ready?	I-OO
G: Yeah, go.	I-OO
DBF: We’re not gonna move a robot we just want to look at where it was lined up a little bit, oh.	O
K: What are you doing? Why are you not going backwards? Okay there we are.	B-DO
G: ((singing))	B-OO
K: No it killed a baby fish.	B-A
G: It's watching it.	B-OO
K: Wait.	I-OO
DBF: You’re just watching it murder the fish.	O
K: Okay we got a (?) we did wrong here.	B-DO
G: I got it	B-OO
K: No I, I, I wanna program. So, so forward, backward, okay wait, wait, wait, we we gotta use the map (?) backwards. Forward um backwards.	B-ATO
G: What?	B-OO
K: Do, do, no do, do	I-OO
G: There, lets try that.	I-OO
K: Yeah lets try that.	I-OO
K: Let’s go,	I-OO
G: Let’s go test it, let’s go test it, let’s go test it. Why is there a baby fish all alone, where’s the mom?	I-OO
K: The mum is...	I-OO
G: No.	I-OO
K: ...that’s the mom, dad and aunt.	I-OO
G: This can’t be the mum it's blue and red not red and yellow.	I-OO
K: It's red, this is the only red one here, so that must be the mum.	I-OO
G: It ca-	I-OO
K: The dad has a yellowish thing so...this is the dad, this is the mom and that’s the uncle.	I-OO
G: Hey baby fish I'm over here, it's beautiful over here. It most certainly is.	I-OO
DBS: Where are you going?	O
DBF: What are you doing?	O
<laughing>	O
A: How’s it running now?	B-OO
G: We don’t know yet.	I-OO
K: We, we don’t know yet.	I-OO
A: Okay, okay just thought I’d go.	I-OO
K: Let it go, let it go, can’t hold it back <singing>.	I-OO
G: Okay that’s good. Ready, on your marks, get set,	I-OO
K: Okay I'm, I'm putting in position.	B-A
G: Oh your marks.	I-A
A: It goes right there.	I-A
G: On your mark, get set...	B-OO
A: Just click it.	I-OO
K: What are you doing?	I-OO
A: Yes	I-OO
K: Er wait why, why, why don’t we go and try again? Yeah.	I-OO
A: Okay, turn, turn, turn yeah, yes, yes, grrrrr.  You are so...	B-DO
K: I spread ebola.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
A: So,	I-OO
G: This one needs to turn more, maybe it should be a right turn and a left turn.	B-ATO
A: It's kind of complicated. Here let me just try putting more power,	B-ATV
10:00 G: I think it needs to be a right turn then a left turn.	B-ATO
A: You can go at seventy two.	B-ATV
K: Let it go let it go ((singing))	B-OO
A: Let me just try this.	I-OO
G: I think it needs, instead of this, this needs to be a right turn.	B-ATO
A: Hold on let me download this first.	B-OO
K: Okay guys so here’s what we wanna do basically.	I-OO
A: We’re already downloading.	I-OO
K: Okay, okay. Well this is basically a plan, go forward, a bit backward and then take the bacteria out, go backwards.	B-ATO
A: Let me download it.	B-OO
K: To the base (?). Backward and then go (?).	B-ATO
A: Yeah download	B-OO
K: I think I know what we’re doing?	I-OO
A: This is touch screen.	I-OO
K: Why’s it not downloading?	I-OO
G: Because you haven’t touched download yet.	I-OO
K: Oh, I really like these (?)	I-OO
RT: How’s it going? What you working on now?	O
G: We’re trying to perfect our design.	B-OO
RT: Awesome	O
A: We’ve got like the basic program and we just (?).	B-OO
RT: Just refining it?	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
RT: Fantastic.	O
K: Okay lets go try it.	B-OO
DBA: Well it comes back correctly.	O
DBF: Yeah but it doesn’t do anything, okay.	O
DBA: That’s a good sign.	O
RT: Moving this in about seven inches. Yeah.	O
DBF: Alright.	O
RT: Let’s do, lets do the whole thing like two more inches that way, great perfect.	O
DBS: Let them try it.	O
RT: No wait, lets, lets (?) it must have been a tilt in the table.	O
DBA: Okay, go ahead.	O
A: It kind of feels, okay Ge- Georgie you are not two.	B-OO
G: Yes I am.	I-OO
<laughing> <screaming>	O
DBA: Lets try it again.	O
DBA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.	O
DBT: Victory.	O
DBF: It worked.	O
G: That was awesome, good job.	B-OO

F: What? Yeah it's not a bad start but, alright...	B-NSTO
S: Hm. So we need to adjust it so that it will go out like this, turn and slam into that	B-DO
F: You can also start it at a specific place like where both of the outside tips over wheels or like touching.	B-A
S: Yeah remember it can’t be out.	I-A
F: Yeah, or like where when we look above it it's like that so, I think that, alright lets watch it again and see which part...whoops, alright, so it went like that, what are we doing...	I-A
S: Hmm, we could do a different process where it circles round like this, backs up and then scoops the bacteria around that?	I-A
F: Yeah alright, let’s have it	I-A
A: I'm just a little concerned  this is sloping a little bit. I’m gonna pull the table, (?) (make sure it doesn’t fall.)	O
S: Oh	B-OO
F: Alright	I-OO
T: Think about (?) never mind I’m not (going to say nothing)	O
F: I think you’re allowed to help us but just not give us an answer.	B-OO
T: Think what’s gonna happen when (you) dump it	O
F: It's going to go there, so we’re going to need to have it go back this way right. Because...	B-A
S: Lyn the robot’s too big	I-A
T: Ha ha ha ha ha ha	O
F: It's your fault, no it's fine, er we need to start it diagonally because if we start it this way it just runs into it and if we started it here it wouldn’t do that.	B-A
S: Well no, wait, wait, wait (Lyn), so say we like work on the (?) like adjust it so that instead of going (?) around like this it will go around like this, move around this one, go forward, back up and then go forward again.	B-ATO
F: I don’t think we need to do that.	B-A
L: Right can I see?	B-OO
F: We can have it go diagonally to, it doesn’t need to be going...	B-A
L: Okay can I see what it does?	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: We wouldn’t want to start it there because it just runs into that so we were starting it more like that. But then it just, it tries to spin all the way round so we don’t need it to spin all the way round so we should have it do like a little turn and then keep going maybe?	B-DO
L: Yeah. Uh	B-OO
F: We should have it (started) a specific measure.	B-A
L: Yeah I wanna see what happens (?). Okay then if we backed it up then it would probably work that don’t touch that one though.	I-A
F: That would yeah.	B-OO
S: Thank you pull it out, pull it out.	I-OO
F: Just touch the machine.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah. Wait don’t touch the lever...	I-OO
F: Ah okay, well (?).	I-OO
A: It broke off, it came off when we fixed it, let me fix the um (?) (it come off) (?) there we are.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay so let’s okay	B-A
F: Did we start it like here yes?	I-A
T: So do you think (?) running into it is a problem?	O
F: No.	B-OO
L: No.	I-OO
T: It's a problem, if you break it it's not gonna be able to work.	O
F: No we’re not...	B-OO
L: That was the wrong, no, no, no.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah it works. After we pulled it out.	I-NSTO
L: Yeah it's a different (?).	B-A
S: (?)	B-OO
F: It’d be cool if there was a thing where you could like, where you could have like a virtual obstacle course and do it on the computer and actually see what it looks like.	B-A
L: Was it right here?	I-A
F: Yeah. Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yay.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah.	I-NSTO
T: Yay	O
<Laughing>	O
L: Yeah we need to figure out how to get it to work.	B-OO
F: Yeah we change, yeah we can change it at this point.	I-OO
L: Oh good.	I-OO
S: Oh yay	I-OO
T: (?) exact question(?) just plough everything	O
S: (?) oh we hit the lever it all fell. It partially worked	B-OO
T: Just think about if this were real life that’s not the way you would get those out of there	O
S: Yeah but if it was real life we wouldn’t be programing a lego cart to do it.	B-OO
T: That’s the idea, think of all the Mars rover you know.	O
F: I know yeah.	B-OO
S: In real life we wouldn’t...	I-OO
F: We wouldn’t have lego bricks	I-OO
S: ...it wouldn’t be this (?).	I-OO
F: If it was real life we could just wash it out in soapy water.	I-OO
S: It wouldn’t even be as big at the lego’s, they’d be tiny.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: We’re not to worry about running over the bacteria.	B-A
L: So what do we do?	B-OO
F: Okay, so right now,	I-OO
L: Right so leave this one for starters.	B-ATO
F: Yes, this one doesn’t work.	I-ATO
L: (We did that).	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
F: Well, right lets	I-OO
L: Mama don’t rain on our parade we kind of got it.	I-OO
F: At least we know how to run the program.	I-OO
T: (?) It was close.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So yay Pru	I-OO
L: Yay of trial and error, that’s why you’re a teacher.	I-OO
T: Safety third! (?)	O
L: Oh my gosh okay. Alrighty so	B-OO
F: We’re gonna d- run it on (?)	I-OO
L: Wait	I-OO
F: Okay, okay I just.	I-OO
L: Yeah I got it.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I got it.	I-OO
F: I got it, I got it.	I-OO
L: I got it okay.	I-OO
F: Okay, so that last one we don’t actually need it to go as (?).	B-DO
L: (?)	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
T: Give me the little (gun/gum)	O
S: Hai	B-OO
L: Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah. (Come on)	I-OO
L: (Yeah it’s close.) Mama you’re not.	I-OO
T: Just ignore me please I’m getting a little (?)	O
L: Okay, sure.	B-OO
F: Okay alright	I-OO
S: I'm gonna do it on (that) draw (?) plan here.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay so what we’re doing is...	B-A
F: Okay, so we have it going diagonal and then making a ninety degree turn,	B-ATV
S: (This space)	B-A
F: So we need it to make a...	B-DO
L: What if we had it go...	I-DO
S: Starting it from right here, so...	B-A
L: This way three times.	B-ATV
F: This one?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: (?) bacteria. This lever and it, it dumps that direction	B-A
L: And then we had a	B-ATO
S: So	B-OO
L: Second turn a little bit harder.	B-ATO
F: The second turn, this one or this one?	I-ATO
S: It needs to go like this,	I-ATO
L: Yeah that one.	I-ATO
S: This	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
S: (C)	I-OO
F: C. Alright, so like two.	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
S: (Turn) then loops and then go back this way (this way)	B-A
F: I think that we should make it go like two and a half maybe.	B-ATV
S: So this is a route we could take.	B-A
F: Right I think we (?) that one.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: I'm just trying to figure out what we’re doing.	B-A
F: Yeah it's good to physically draw it out.	I-A
S: Are we gonna go for the um other bacteria places as well.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Well yeah. Er not so far.	B-DO
F: What? What?	B-OO
L: The, it turned like all the way we don’t need it go all the way round.	B-ATO
F: Alright, so just (two)?	B-ATV
F: Yeah. Wait, don’t play yet, okay go. I think that Sarah we go more diagonally.	B-ATO
S: That’s right yeah.	B-OO
F: Lets start it diagonal so we can see	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: And put something in relation to where the bacteria...	B-A
S: Alright. Sarah can we have your tissue or a tissue.	B-OO
F: Here you go.	I-OO
L: Er	I-OO
F: Here. Yeah	I-OO
L: Like here would you say?	B-A
F: Er so this is the square it's more like here.	I-A
L: It's okay. We obviously run into the truck	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And we miss it.	B-A
F: Alright, we don’t need it to go that far, oh wait no. No.	B-DO
L: Wait... No.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: You fool, no!	I-OO
S: Oi, don’t take my catchphrase.	I-OO
L: Well I'm not calling Fiona a fool I'm calling the robot a fool.	I-OO
F: Yes	I-OO
L: What if we went farther on this for here?	B-ATO
F: This one? Which one?	I-ATO
L: Yeah. That.	B-OO
F: This, this (D and C). (Do)	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Oi, stop.	B-NSTO
L: Stop.	I-NSTO
S: (Okay and some bacteria)	B-A
L: Stop (?) stop it, no, oh it's (running) (?) okay.	B-NSTO
S: (Probably) over.	B-A
F: Alright, got to try it again. I think like this is the (?), be more like that (?).	I-A
S: See so...	I-A
F: Really close.	B-NSTO
L: Do you wanna try it?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: Okay so (?).	I-OO
F: (That’s right)	I-OO
F: Okay so it's the Banbury  Cheese underscore one. Oh wait we can (?).	B-QS
L: Okay (right well) you got the (map).	B-OO
S: Uh?	I-OO
L: Did you get a map?	I-OO
S: I'm getting a map (?) later.	I-OO
F: Alright okay	I-OO
L: Cool. Right so...	I-OO
L: Like that?	B-A
F: Yeah, yeah.	B-OO
L: It's gonna run into the trucks so I'm gonna back it up some.	B-A
F: Or we could, we should start it consistently at the same place.	I-A
L: Yeah I shall put a...	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: ...thing at the correct tire.	B-A
F: What, what, what? Okay, no it needs to go further.	B-DO
L: Alright needs to be...	I-DO
F: Or we can start it here.	B-A
L: Yeah, wait... why did they?	B-OO
F: No	I-OO
L: Well they did fall.	B-DO
F: Yay <laughs>	B-OO
S: So it’ll dump this way, round here, down here.	B-A
F: So we’re gonna need it to go...	B-DO
L: So far at the back.	I-DO
F: We’re gonna need it to go like this far, we don’t need it to go as far as it’s going I think, lets not change the distance because we want to change the programing rather than just changing where we start the thing,	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Cos want to be consistent, so it should probably go like to here and then make a ninety degree turn and then go straight.	B-ATV
S: Down (?)	B-A
F: So lets see how far it goes now.  So we only need it to do a smaller turn, we need it to do a smaller turn after that, lets try that first.	B-ATO
L: Yeah	B-OO
S: Oh are we gonna get that bacteria base by the fish as well.	B-A
F: What? I don’t think we’re gonna do, lets focus on this thing right now, because I don’t think we need to...oh you mean how are we gonna get around the fish?	I-A
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: Ploughing, I don’t know.	B-A
L: And we could probably ignore that one for now.	B-OO
S: I know how we’re gonna get (?) the way back	B-A
L: Yeah we could...	B-OO
F: Alright, wait plug it in.	B-QR
L: Wait not yet.	B-OO
F: Not yet.	I-OO
L: Which ones do you have marked out? Sarah.	I-OO
S: Um what? Which ones do I have?	I-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
S: Okay so I have the ones that are far back (?)exact measurement but, this is how we do it, so we exit, so...	B-A
M: Lunch in five minutes.	O
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: ...so we leave the base here like after we shovel these ones in and reset it to go here then we move past here towards the (cooling) plant (?) stop right in front of it, move up, circle round it and then we hit the one at the far left corner first, we move around after we hit the lever on that one we move round the back, go around hit this one’s lever...	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: ...then we move around one more time, collect the thing, how did I do this, then we go down here and be caught.	B-A
F: Alright, okay, do you think it's realistic to be able to think that we’re gonna scoop up all of them because the points only count for the scooped up ones?	I-A
S: No I don’t think that the...	B-OO
F: The point, the points only count for the scooped up ones if all them are scooped into the base.	B-A
S: Okay (?).	B-OO
F: It's here on the bacteria one, twelve points each if no bacteria is touching the mat outside the base.  So that means we could either scoop in like a couple of them and get all the bacteria in or, or knock over all of them and just go back to the base.	B-A
S: Well I don’t think there’s a way we can get all them because they scatter really easily.	I-A
F: It's weird it does like, oh did you change this one? Maybe we could it one point two.	B-ATV
F: Wait, what did it do?	B-DO
I think something was... Yeah that’s a good turn.	I-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright,	I-OO
L: Lets save that then.	I-OO
F: (?)	I-OO
L: Did you save this?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay, so it's saved as Banbury cheese underscore bacteria.	I-OO
L: Sarah we’re gonna go and check it if you want to come or keep on working on your (map).	I-OO
S: Um I’ll come.	I-OO
F: You can move any of this stuff away I think.	I-OO
L: Yeah, this is where we were started.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And they was like on the top.	B-A
F: And this is on the bottom.	I-A
L: You ready?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Perfect.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah, then how do we get it out> oh we can have it, how do we have it go back.	B-A
S: Okay so you guys have this one figured out.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: But for the ones down here...	B-A
L: We still need to figure out how to get it out (though).	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Okay we attach the thing on the base on the back...	B-D
F: We’re not gonna worry about the (bulldozers)...	I-D
L: But I think that’s actually a really good idea.	B-A
F: I know it is a gre-, it is a good idea but if we made it, it would have to be consistent enough to get everything back or else the points don’t count at all.	I-A
L: Well it wouldn’t have to get it back. Would we?	I-A
F: Oh so that it would just move it out of the way so the thing could move.	I-A
L: Yeah so a bit like the plough would like just get through there.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: So that would be like...	B-A
F: Cool.	B-OO
L: ...yo we’re out yeah okay.	B-A
F: Okay that’s great.	B-OO
S: Okay, so (about) the ones down here, so you leave here, you go right here, you go to exit this, go right here and go you circle round that way (?) go down here almost straight (?).	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
S: (?) back to base	B-A
F: Cool let’s...	B-OO
L: (?)...one more time there?	I-OO
F: Yeah so this would be there, and that’s right there.	B-A
L: (?) Yeah okay.	B-OO
S: Did it just run over it?	B-DO
F: Yes it did.	B-OO
L: Okay lets try that again.	I-OO
F: And that no, it needs to be very specific.	B-A
L: Did not go to the right spot.	B-DO
F: It needs to be very specific about it, no we can’t have any...yeah.	B-A
L: Hmm no it's been going there.	B-DO
F: It's been going there but it's not consit- they are not lining it up consistently enough.	B-A
L: It just runs it over.	B-DO
F: It's tipping the, the thing is...maybe it’s just...	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
L: (?) Yeah okay.	I-OO
F: Why isn’t it doing it, that’s weird.	B-NSTO
LUNCH BREAK	O
S: Somebody’s crabby.	B-OO
L: Me?	I-OO
S: Yes.	I-OO
L: No I just want to get back to work.	I-OO
S: Okay so here’s a battle plan for our next target.	I-OO
F: Alright do you want to start build, Sarah do you want to start building a plough thing that can go on the back?	I-OO
S: Okay how are we gonna do that?	B-D
F: I don’t know lets look at the back of it, are there any...	I-D
L: Okay, well why don’t...	B-OO
F: ...places where things can go in.	B-D
L: This.	B-OO
L: Why don’t Sarah, why don’t you build like a prototype sort of thing and (?).	B-D
S: But I don’t know how to build a plough.	I-D
L: Oh there we go okay.	B-OO
S: I'm completely useless at Legos.	I-OO
F: You’ll be able to figure it out there’s some easy stuff to do.	I-OO
L: Which (Banbury cheese) (?).	B-QS
S: Figure it out seriously.	B-OO
F: Banberry Cheese underscore	B-QS
S: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay lets go try it out, lets like try it (?).	I-OO
S: Let me see if they have plough instructions.	B-D
L: Plough construction.	I-D
S: Plough instructions.	I-D
L: I doubt that they do but...	B-OO
S: Don’t ruin my thunder here.	I-OO
F: Can we use that for a second? Thanks.	I-OO
L: Okay we had it, so we had it here right.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Oh my god.	B-NSTO
F: Why is it running it over?	B-DO
S: I don’t know.	B-OO
F: Okay so this one’s like.	B-A
L: Okay give it a try again.	B-OO
S: What the?	B-NSTO
L: (Let me try)	B-OO
S: I think the like lever’s broken...	B-A
L: I think (?)...	B-OO
S: ...it shouldn’t be so low.	B-A
L: Let me just move it back a little bit. Don’t worry I get it higher.	I-A
S: I'm just trying to get it to not run over the lever.	B-DO

S: Okay what do you want me to draw, where do you want me to put it?	B-OO
L: We don’t have that, which one are you doing?	I-OO
F: Number two.	I-OO
L: Number two	I-OO
S: Neither one.	I-OO
F: Number two.	I-OO
L: Well you don’t have to yet.	I-OO
S: Okay so number two. Er two,	I-OO
L: Lets see which ones (a four) (?)	I-OO
F: I think it's over about two and then it... yeah	B-A
L: Yeah I'm just wondering about Sarah’s map, Sarah are you calling this like what corner, what corner (?).	I-A
S: Okay, base corner, other stuff that doesn’t matter corners.	I-A
L: Sarah my question is, is this so, are you saying that, are you saying that’s like this?	I-A
F: Okay I think it's (two)	I-A
S: Okay whatever way you look at the base thing that’s how it's gonna be.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Wherever you...	I-OO
L: It goes like this then?	B-A
S: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay so I think it's... um	B-A
S: I can drop the (?).	I-A
F: Oh Lyn you can make it degrees for the turns.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just a second.	I-OO
L: What’s that one?	I-OO
S: What do you think it is?	I-OO
L: Don’t know.	I-OO
F: Sarah do you mind if I...	I-OO
L: (?) snake.	I-OO
F: ...do you mind if I change the turns to ninety degrees	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: So it's just more exact? I didn’t realise you could do that.	B-ATV
S: No my corn snake is (this). That’s most of the snake Lyn, it's chiseled, look at its chiseled abs.	B-OO
L: Okay so I think that works like this, it's two down and two in so I think it's right here.	B-A
F: Alright cool.	B-OO
S: So about right here?	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Be right there actually.	B-A
F: So Lyn I changed all the turns to ninety degrees just so it would be consistent (?)...	B-ATV
S: Exact?	B-OO
F: ...change it by the degree rather than by the rotation, I think that makes a little more sense.	B-ATV
L: Alright, yeah that looks right Sarah.	B-OO
S: Okay, so that’s for number two.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Nap time.	I-OO
L: If you want to take a break you can always go outside.	I-OO
S: No I don’t want to take a break I'm just being weird.	I-OO
F: If you wanna like sit down for a second it's fine.	I-OO
S: You realise I am sitting right?	I-OO
F: No I mean like while, if we’re testing out stuff you don’t have to walk back and forth if you don’t want to.	I-OO
S: I’ll be fine I'm not that weak.	I-OO
F: No it's fine, it's like...	I-OO
S: Oh, she’s copying my notch mat.	I-OO
F: How dare you...artistic licence.	I-OO
S: They’re not even Lyn.	I-OO
L: Sarah doesn’t matter, no Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah stop.	I-OO
S: Sorry (?) picky, a control freak when it comes to maps.	I-OO
L: Alright (?).	I-OO
F: We could work on the Banbury Cheese (?).	I-OO
L: Yeah Sarah you could always work on the banner right now instead.	I-OO
S: Fine.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Plus I don’t want to draw the cheese.	I-OO
L: Did you program (it Fiona)?	I-OO
F: Okay, ah I did the next turn, um, let’s actually just try it on the ground.	I-OO
L: Okay did you save it?	I-OO
F: No it's still plugged in here, I’ll, I’ll save it and just try it on the ground, but I want to add another thing before...	B-ATO
S: No it’ll be like this...it’ll be like this.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Put that frog down.	I-OO
T: What you doing another one?	O
F: What? Lyn	B-OO
L: What	I-OO
S: (?) making a map.	I-OO
F: Why is this going wrong the ninety degree turns aren’t working, watch what it does, it's going like, the first one works, no but it doesn’t, alright lets change it back to revolution.	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: It's like a turtle, if you flip it over on it's back it doesn’t do (anything) alright lets change it, that would have been cool though but...	B-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright. And the number of rotations...	B-ATV
L: I think actually I have to go outside for a minute.	B-OO
F: That’s fine.	I-OO
L: Cos I’m getting a very bad headache. Mama are you coming?	I-OO
T: I’d love to come  (?)	O
F: Sure I, I think I need to breathe a little bit.	B-OO
T: (?) little (break). (?) tic tac	O
F: Oh a tic tac.	B-OO
<microphones off while team takes a break>	O
F: Okay, oh okay.	B-OO
F: Okay so we’ve got that turn.	B-ATO
L: Do you want to check number one save what we have now...	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: I feel like it's not really super consistent.	B-DO
L: Okay, it looks like it...	B-OO
S: Fiona we’re not about consistency here, we’re about dumb luck.	I-OO
F: Ha ha ha	I-OO
S: And consistency.	I-OO
L: Okay we also have a map now (?), so okay lets bring the map for number one.	B-A
S: Where’s my mappy map? Oh there it is.	B-OO
L: Okay	I-OO
<General classroom noise>	O
F: I don’t think that... Er we asked about the rats thing too but on this one there aren’t any rats.	B-OO
F: Oh thanks.	I-OO
L: Oh Sarah can I see the map?	I-OO
S: Which one are we testing?	I-OO
F: One.	I-OO
L: Are we saying this?	I-OO
F: Oh lets...	I-OO
S: It's lined up with the words base.	B-A
L: Okay so that one.	I-A
F: And this one is gonna go (?).	B-DO
S: Oh right, backwards.	I-DO
L: (?) backwards.	I-DO
F: This one’s short, it’s almost done probably.	B-QR
L: Okay. Whoops.	B-NSTO
S: It just caught barely on the edge.	B-DO
F: Okay, okay.	B-NSTO
L: Okay lets try that again.	B-OO
S: Wait (grab) (these two).	I-OO
F: It would be cool to do this with like a really long time to work on it, alright lets make it parallel to the word base.	B-A
L: Well that didn’t work.	B-NSTO
F: No but it was closer, like if we lined it up with, if we line the edge of the napkin up with these tick marks and made it like this.	B-A
L: Like that okay. Oh that thing. Yeah that did not work.	B-NSTO
S: It's, it's (?).	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think those things are interfering a bit. Huh	B-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Trying to figure out original line up.	B-A
Y: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Like that?	B-A
L: (?) start it?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: No it needs to be farther back.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Like so.	B-A
F: Yeah, so line up with the corner	I-A
L: Okay wait. No, farther back? Is that what’s wrong?	B-DO
F: Maybe it was like here, maybe it was...	B-A
L: What about like that?	I-A
F: No, that messed it up.	B-NSTO
S: Sorry Lyn.	B-OO
F: I think it was more like that, like it was lined up like that. No.	B-A
L: No. Here?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Except we can’t remember how we lined it up. That works.	B-A
F: No it doesn’t.	B-NSTO
S: Oh come on.	I-NSTO
L: Okay well now we know it has to be more in that direction okay you guys can...	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Oh what’s this? I think this thing broke.	I-OO
S: I can’t believe you guys got eyes and we didn’t.	I-OO
L: We have eyes. Yeah, Sarah we have eyes.	I-OO
F: But we’re not using them Sarah so we don’t need them.	I-OO
S: Well you guys look (?) bulldozing (?) we look like a square.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think we have like another hour for this, so we’re not in a super big rush or anything.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Sarah, stop dripping things.	I-OO
S: Where’s our other map?	I-OO
L: It's right there.	I-OO
S: Did we leave the map somewhere?	I-OO
L: No Sarah it's right here.	I-OO
F: Can you hold on to this?	I-OO
S: Okay. Oh you wrote it on the back of my evil genius list.	I-OO
L: Yeah, (what’s the evil genius list?).	I-OO
F: Ha ha .hhh	I-OO
S: We got bored at one moment it was (a laugh)	I-OO
F: It's a long story.	I-OO
S: It was a desperation measure.	I-OO
F: Oh (?).	I-OO
<microphones off during cookie break>	O
F: Alright, lets	B-OO
L: I think it was supposed to be like here, because that’s what it was at before	B-A
F: Like (windup). (?) here alright	I-A
L: Okay	B-OO
LGS: Marina come on this one.	O
L: Okay not, so maybe more here?	B-A
F: Maybe. Oh that worked.	B-NSTO
S: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yay.	I-OO
S: Okay (test).	I-OO
F: (?)	I-OO
L: Wait, Fiona where were we at?	B-A
F: I don’t remember.	B-OO
S: You were about like right here. (I guess)	B-A
L: Do you wanna write that down Sarah?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: Because.	I-OO
L: On the tissue.	I-OO
S: I'm getting it, I'm getting the tissues.	I-OO
F: huh huh	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: (?) you’re (?). Okay what one, which one’s were they?	B-A
L: Hold on. Okay, Fiona can tell you what’s the first one I think.	I-A
S: Which one’s were they?	I-A
F: Oh.	B-NSTO
L: No...	I-NSTO
F: ha ha ha ha	B-OO
S: That works.	B-NSTO
F: Beautiful. Flawless.	I-NSTO
S: Okay which, which ones were they?	B-A
F: Erm	B-OO
S: Which one’s were they lined up between?	B-A
F: We’re not gonna move a robot we just wanna look at where it was lined up a little bit, oh...	I-A
LGS: No it killed the baby fish.	O
F: You’re just watching it murder helpless animals.	B-OO
L: So	B-OO
F: I think it was lined up.	B-A
L: (?).	B-OO
F: Oh this one?	B-A
L: No I think it was, okay, one, two, three...right can you put it down (this way)	I-A
F: (And) this one. I think.	I-A
L: Okay seven on this side Sarah you can just write it down, so seven on the right and...	I-A
F: Like three on the left.	I-A
L: Four, well I'm counting the line.	I-A
F: Yeah, four.	I-A
L: Seven right, four left.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay let’s (?)	I-OO
LGS: Why is there a baby fish all alone with the mat.	O
LGS2: Um the mama’s there	O
L: No that was in (?).  Okay scratch that Sarah.	B-NSTO
F: You killed all of them.	B-OO
S: Okay, just find the right things and then tell me.	I-OO
L: Okay, wait, that’s one, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three...	B-A
LGS2: Red, this is the only red one, that must be the mum.	O
LGS: The dad has yellowish thing so...this is the dad, this is the mum that (?).	O
F: Maybe we could ask your mum if we could take pictures if she has a phone or something.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Maybe we could take pictures of it.	I-OO
L: Okay, go ahead.	I-OO
F: No, that doesn’t...	B-NSTO
L: Wait Where are you going?	I-NSTO
F: What?	B-OO
S: (?)	I-OO
F: What are you doing? Huh huh	B-NSTO
S: Bad robot?	I-NSTO
LGS: We don’t know, we don’t know yet.	O
LGT: Okay, okay just jot it down.	O
L: Okay lets ask er (?) madre okay	B-OO
LG: <singing>	O
L: I shall go find her	B-OO
F: ...okay	I-OO
S: Okay come on, wake up.	I-OO
F: <<singing>>	O
L: Hey mama we need your phone.	B-OO
S: What are you doing to me Sarah?	I-OO
L: Take photos	I-OO
S: Something fun, how would you like a butt tattoo?	I-OO
F: No thank you.	I-OO
S: Okay I was just gonna do a kitty.	I-OO
F: Okay fine, if it turns into a butt I'm going to kill you.	I-OO
S: Why would I draw a butt on you?	I-OO
F: Sarah it's turning into a butt.	I-OO
S: No it isn’t, wait five seconds.	I-OO
F: Oh okay, I thought it was gonna be a butt.	I-OO
S: Would you like me to draw a butt?	I-OO
L: I have a camera.	I-OO
D: Okay.	I-OO
L: Are you ready?	I-OO
S: Wait one second.	I-OO
L: Hey Sarah can you stop drawing the cat on (?).	I-OO
F: Thank you Sarah, thank you.	I-OO
L: Hey guys.	I-OO
F: I feel like my life is complete now okay, are you done?	I-OO
S: No.	I-OO
F: Okay I'm done, yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay. Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Start it?	I-OO
F: Yeah lets take a picture.	I-OO
L: I just did.	I-OO
F: Oh okay.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: We delete (?).	I-OO
F: What are you trying to do?	B-NSTO
S: Victory.	I-NSTO
<laughs>	O
F: Okay we can delete those ones so we know that it's not...	B-OO
S: No save it to that or not... save it until we know where we went wrong.	I-OO
F: Oh (?).	I-OO
L: Okay yeah I have (?) okay lets...	I-OO
F: What is it doing like did we mess up the programming for it?	B-DO
L: Okay lets go. Are you ready?	B-OO
F: Is it Banbury one?	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Charge.	I-OO
L: Well it comes back correctly.	B-DO
F: Yeah but it doesn’t do anything. (Okay)	B-NSTO
L: That’s a good sign.	B-OO
C: Can I actually (?) about seven inches.Yeah (that’s gonna be good).	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
C: Lets do, lets do the whole thing like two more inches that way.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
C: Wait perfect.	O
S: Now try it.	B-OO
F: No wait, lets, lets wait okay.	I-OO
T: It must have been the top of the table (?).	O
L: Okay go ahead.	B-OO
F: (?) no, no not at all.	I-OO
L: Go ahead Fiona.	I-OO
S: Pretty close.	B-NSTO
LGS: You knocked two.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: What?	B-NSTO
DBT: WOOOOOO	O
L: Lets try it again.	B-OO
S: Yeah, yeah, yeah.	I-OO
F: No.	I-OO
S: See if it works again. If it actually worked...	I-OO
F: Victory.	B-NSTO
S: Victory by default.	I-NSTO
LGS: That was awesome.	O
F: Worked so well <laughs>	B-NSTO
L: One, two, one two three, four, five, six, seven.	B-A
F: And that one’s lined up with the E.	I-A
L: One two three four five six seven. Are you sure?	I-A
F: I think it was more like...	I-A
L: They’d know it was (?).	I-A
F: It was covering the V.	I-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: No according to this photo...	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: ...it was covering the V, the back wheel.	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
S: I’m making it better.	I-OO
L: (?) go ahead what?	I-OO
F: Oh it didn’t do it again.	B-NSTO
L: Oh okay.	B-OO
F: And where were...	B-A
L: Just start it.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Wherever you want.	B-A
F: Um, lets start it here.	I-A
L: Go ahead.	B-OO
F: That works.	B-NSTO
S: Woow...	I-NSTO
L: Yay okay one more time. Sorry this will be our last one...	B-OO
F: Just so we can say, just so we know we’re consistent.	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
S: All the tops are falling off.	I-OO
F: Meh.	I-OO
S: Is that all you can say for yourselves?	I-OO
F: Meh.	I-OO
L: Yeah, okay	I-OO
S: Lyn is rubbing off on you Fiona.	I-OO
F: Meh.	I-OO
F: Like that?	B-A
F: Wait, that was more like...	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Can’t believe they drew a map on the back of my evil genius list. (I got bored).	I-OO
F: No... Meh.	B-NSTO
S: Well that (wheel is)	B-OO
L: Okay you guys can (?).	I-OO
S: (?) map on it.	I-OO

A: They’re cleaning it up.	B-OO
K: I know.	I-OO
A: Yeah, Eve would do that.	I-OO
K: Eve would do that.	I-OO
A: Maybe.	I-OO
K: Oh it's broken, what did I do? Oh my gosh. This is...	I-OO
A: Thank you.	I-OO
K: Miss (?) where were you?	I-OO
T: I was (?). How did you get on?	O
K: Well Eve is, Eve is the step of world domination.	B-OO
A: It's okay, don’t worry.	I-OO
G: It was an accident.	I-OO
K: It was all her fault.	I-OO
A: I did the same thing.	I-OO
K: Eve is the one, I just noticed something, Eve is the one who spread ebola.	I-OO
G: Is there an Eve in this (?).	I-OO
A: Got to program everything all over again. Maybe we should scratch all our programming and start	B-A
G: Yeah trying something else.	B-OO
A: Okay now if we don’t get somewhere in like the next thirteen minutes.	I-OO
G: I've scratched it and then done it three times.	I-OO
A: Oh my god. Hey you better work, because we’re counting on you. Okay, okay.	I-OO
G: Wait, don’t touch it.	I-OO
K: I wasn’t touching it. I have an idea, we should bring our computer, wait no never mind.	B-A
G: It's working.	B-NSTO
A: No the cow, the cow, the cow.	I-NSTO
G: It came down this way then I need to angle.	B-DO
K: Hey.	B-OO
A: We figured out what happened.	B-DO
K: Georgie,	B-OO
A: Here,	I-OO
K: Georgie we should dele-, oh we should scratch all (?)	I-OO
A: No right there	I-OO
K: We should no, we should scratch the ones that we’re not using	I-OO
G: Okay, this, this one. That one we’re using just in case.	I-OO
K: Do you know what we’re doing wrong, here let me upload this.	I-OO
G: What are you doing?	I-OO
K: I'm, I'm, I'm putting this up on the computer.	I-OO
G: Because I figured out what we need to do.	I-OO
K: Hmm, hmm, what, what’s that?	I-OO
G: You’ll see.	I-OO
K: Where’s my phone?	I-OO
A: Whoever’s listening to this, goodbye, I'm turning you off again.	I-OO
K: Ha ha	I-OO
G: Why are you turning it off?	I-OO
K: No she’s not.	I-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha (joke’s on you). I was gonna turn it off.	I-OO
K: We’re friends right? Are we friends?	I-OO
G: No.	I-OO
A: No (seriously are we friends now).	I-OO
K: He doesn’t hear you Georgie or she. I just call, okay your name is Oliver, your name is Oliver. Hi Oliver.	I-OO
A: Everything’s all set up.	I-OO
K: I name the person who is listening me right now (?) his name’s Oliver. Hi Oliver how are you?	I-OO
A: Oh can I press it. I think it should be more that way.	B-A
K: Press it just press it.	B-OO
G: It was fine, here.	I-OO
A: Yes.	I-OO
K: Oh no, no it wasn’t,	I-OO
T: (?) baby fish	O
G: We weren’t going for the fish anyway, we were going for the ball and we’re not worrying about the fish.	B-A
A: It's going. No...	B-NSTO
K: You spread Ebola again.	B-OO
G: Why do you guys keep picking it up?	I-OO
A: It hit the thing, it was gonna go hi-...	B-DO
TM: Lets push this table back a little bit, there we go.	O
G: It may have hit but it doesn’t mean it's not working, it may just be stuck for a second. Don’t touch it	B-OO
A: See...	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: Why is it like to the straight...	B-DO
G: Oh wait no leave it like that because then we have all these points	B-OO
A: Yee hah.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Oh my gosh what is wrong, no we just learnt the creative way of getting...	B-OO
G:  (?).	O
K: ...all the virus we just (?) points.	B-OO
T: Cool	O
G: Let’s try this again.	B-OO
J: Yeah lets just...	I-OO
G: We have to make sure, we have to perfect the angle again. What are you doing?	B-A
K: I'm taping it.	B-OO
G: Okay so it has the... It was angled like right here.	B-A
A: Yeah	B-OO
A: Turn, turn.	B-DO
K: Oh my god Eve.	B-NSTO
<laughing>	O
K: Oh god (?).	B-NSTO
G: That doesn’t work.	I-NSTO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: It worked the first time.	B-NSTO
A: It's really like close (enough).	I-NSTO
G: Like this? No, I'm gonna position it because (?).	B-A
A: Like at this point we shouldn’t even care.	B-OO
K: Yeah but it's a competition.	I-OO
A: I didn’t come here to compete. Woooh  Evil, evil,	I-OO
G: Stop touching it, you keep moving the stuff, you keep picking it up, hey is this your phone?	I-OO
K: Yeah. Eve you didn’t try to steal it did you?	I-OO
A: Knowing that stupid thing it...	I-OO
G: Or did she? Or did she?	I-OO
A: Okay, okay Eve there you go, go, go, go.	B-NSTO
K: Can I try to program it?	B-OO
G: It worked, it worked so good.	B-NSTO
K: Hey let me try to program it?	B-OO
G: But we had programmed it. It worked, it worked we got a lot of points and then it didn’t work.	B-DO
A: It knocked the whole entire thing over.	I-DO
DGT: Where did you start it?	O
DGS: Here, here.	O
DGT: That’s (?) that’s why because that’s not (?) did it last time right? It's gotta be, each time you bring it back to base.	O
G: Where’s our angler?	B-A
K: It’s okay here’s our angler so.	I-A
G: We can angle it (?) next time	I-A
A: Right let me see the program, I wanna try and tweak it.	B-OO
K: Yeah you can help me tweak it, because, okay so I need to see what happens... So here’s what I'm trying	I-OO
A: Sorry.	I-OO
40:00 K: We, we can go straight like, like that and then like  we’re keeping the front and back.	B-ATO
A: So it goes forward. It comes backward.	I-ATO
K: Forward, backward and then instead we can go like a bit in front and then like no, wait a minute.	I-ATO
A: Don’t tweak anything past here.	I-ATO
K: Yeah. We move right. Ha ha, I think this is gonna work like that and then we...	I-ATO
A: We need Eve.	B-OO
G: Perfect ha ha	I-OO
A: We need Eve. I'm gonna go get Eve. We need her.	I-OO
K: Now I need this to be straight.	B-ATO
A: Give me the port.	B-OO
K: I'm taking it. Okay, see how it is so far, see how it is so far.	I-OO
A: Probably just messed the whole thing up.	I-OO
G: That’s the cow we accidently destroyed.	I-OO
K: Are you saying that (?).	I-OO
A: No I'm just saying that I'm (done with) this.	I-OO
G: We killed a cow. We knocked its head off.	I-OO
A: Is it good?	I-OO
G: Lets see you have a point here, you have a point there, you have four points there.	I-OO
A: I'm pressing it.	I-OO
K: Yeah, okay, press it. Okay try it, try it.	I-OO
DGT: Which program are you running right now?	O
DGS: (?).	O
DHT: That’s not the first (?) that you had, try the first one that you had.	O
K: Can we have Eve back please?	B-OO
T: (?) it's another virus.	O
A: Eve is ready to be tested one more.	B-OO
DGT: (?) you started it at lego and then it came a little and then it (?).	O
K: And then I’ll see what I can do next?	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
DGS: That one?	O
DGT: Yeah because then you can have it going straight right? Right lets (?).	O
A: Try it, it has been tweaked. All of ours is destructive.	B-OO
G: Press that...	I-OO
A: What are you doing? Restart...	B-NSTO
G: Lets try this again.	B-OO
K: How is it working?	I-OO
A: Awful. Oh it's slowly going backwards oh I see.	B-ATO
T: It's slowly going backwards.	O
K: Oh I see!	B-OO
G: What did you guys do to it?	I-OO
A: I didn’t, she did, I got it.	I-OO
K: Hey.	I-OO
A: Hey we all make mistakes.	I-OO
G: Where...	I-OO
K: So...	I-OO
A: Here I got it.	I-OO
G: It's right here, needs to go faster.	B-ATV
A: We had like a road map of what it like looked like. You are a naughty robot.	B-A
A: Wait, can we have some paper and a pen?	B-OO
YT: What?	O
A: Is it all set?	B-OO
K: Can we have some paper and a pen?	I-OO
YT: A pen?	O
K: I need a paper and a pen.	B-OO
A: Where’s our jig?	B-A
K: Oh okay. Aha thanks.	B-OO
G: No.	I-OO
A: That’s not right angle, (fix) all them fishes.	B-A
G: Proper grammar please?	B-OO
A: Close enough. Hey. Mm mm. Mm mm. You’re bad, you’re very bad.	B-NSTO
G: I'm just gonna do a whole other program.	B-OO
K: Oh paper, paper, paper.	I-OO
A: No I think we can,	I-OO
G: So we want it to move forward, how many five? Then after five we want it to reverse.	B-ATV
K: Okay so how is this gonna go? The base is right here right? There’s one right here, one right here. Wait I'm looking at the map, oh I'm sorry about that.	B-ATO
G: Then we want this to move to, that way.	I-ATO
A: So are we starting again.	B-OO
G: Yeah. Do a u-turn.	B-ATO
A: Whoever is listening, I am so sorry you have to listen to me for four hours.	B-OO
G: Me too.	I-OO
A: Like you must have an awful job, that or they’re just paying you a lot of money and you decided to do it.	I-OO
G: And then I need it right turn ...and then one, two, three, four, five. And then a slight left turn. And then...forward and then have to go straight, right turn...	B-ATO
K: Look this is a really rough scale of what we’re going through.	B-A
A: Ha, ha, ha, ha.	B-OO
K: What we’re going to do (it) (?). Hey guys.	I-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: Okay so this is basically a really rough map, so maybe we can use this to help us program.	B-A
G: And then backwards.	B-ATO
A: That’s done.	B-OO
G: Done.	I-OO
A: Oh program it. Eve, Eve, Eve.	I-OO
K: Guys map.	I-OO
A: Lets go. And we have an idea of what we’re doing. I guess.	I-OO
K: Oh, yes...	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: I swear if Eve can do that one more time.	B-NSTO
T: This is cool.	O
K: Oh gosh. Okay.	B-OO
YT: Now then need to program it to get back to the base and then...that’s pretty good	O
T: That’s pretty awesome.	O
A: No, we got to keep trying because she’s unpredictable.	B-DO
K: Yeah she’s definitely very unpredictable	I-DO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
A: Oh I see why, hold on I see why.  You remember how like last time it just ran over the fish?	B-DO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: It needs more that way.	B-DO
K: That’s genius.	B-OO
G: Oops.	I-OO
A: Eve, bad girl.	I-OO
K: Okay the person that’s listening to him, I don’t know if it's a girl or boy so I'm just naming him Oliver.	I-OO
T: Oliver.	O
K: Hi Oliver.	B-OO
A: We really need to perfect (the early)	B-A
K: Okay,	B-OO
A: Here try it right...	I-OO
K: Are you having a lot of fun ta- when we’re talking about Eve’s evil deeds.	I-OO
K: Maybe we should go.	B-A
G: We need more force. I got this.	B-DO
K: Yeah we got this, we got this.	B-OO
A: Hang on.  For the first one...	I-OO
K: Yeah we’re (gateway)	I-OO
A: First one	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: All the way up.	I-OO
A: I'm dreading this.	I-OO
K: So (the way that we’re supposed to do it is). Okay.	I-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
G: I think we just need to figure out um...	B-A
A: This is gonna be a lot of force, just saying.	B-ATV
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Ready?  (?)	I-OO
K: Go.	I-OO
A: I’m prepared to hit it. It's taking (?).	B-A
K: Oh my god it almost did.	B-NSTO
G: Restart.	B-OO
A: Restart everything, someone go over there and do that.	I-OO
K: It almost took the fish to the base, we almost got a point.	B-A
A: Are you ready?	B-OO
G: Ready?	I-OO
A: You’d better do this right.	I-OO
G: Set, go.	I-OO
K: Better angle?	B-A
G: Reset.	B-OO
K: Do it with different angle.	B-A
G: Ready, set...	B-OO
A : (?).	O
G: Stop touching it.	B-OO
A: I thought we were still perfecting this.	I-OO
K: Hurry, hurry, get your fingers out. Okay, we need to angle it a bit more here, kind of like here.	B-A
A: Hold on. Can I see the robot thingy for a second, I think I figured out a good angle. You keep trouble shooting. Go like this, start it, lego so the ball’s on lego. Okay so what are you doing? Start back here.	I-A
K: Come on. That missed it.	B-DO
A: Here someone wants to test.	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Why don’t we just like get rid of it.	I-OO
K: You sat on my seat,	I-OO
A: No	I-OO
50:00 K: Idiot. I don’t like you anymore.	I-OO
A: I hate you.	I-OO
K: Hey juveniles.	I-OO
G: (?) stop fighting.	I-OO
T: (?) good drawings.	O
K: This is kind of a rough map, so it will help us kind of program.	B-A
T: Like when you come back here you can figure out like (?).	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
T: It should be going backwards here, should be going forwards here.	O
K: Yeah. Like for instance this is...	B-OO
A: Eve. Eve right here.	O
K: That’s a beautiful picture of Eve. Just saying. She, what we have to do is we have to program her at full speed, kind of like go here so the ball would kind of knock off somewhere.	B-A
T: Hmm.	B-OO
K: And the fish, one fish will be like closer here so...Eve can also on her path of destruction	B-A
T: Hm mm	O
K: Can go over here and like knock it out.	B-A
T: Hmm, hmm.	O
K: What I'm hoping is that the fish can go back with her to almost the base, so we might take the backwards route a bit farther.  She can go forward again and then right, get that...	B-A
T: I thought she knocked all of the things down that one time, like...	O
K: Maybe we can push the forward...	B-A
T: Did she go at an angle?	O
K: No. It possibly did, maybe we should push the forward part a bit longer. I'm tired, I'm talking (?).	B-A
A: (?)	O
K: ((singing))	O
A: This is frustrating.	B-OO
G: Yeah tell me about it. Oh my god.	I-OO
A: Hey you, you can go outside and take a break for a minute.	I-OO
K: Again.	I-OO
G: I am finishing this. Yes. So now all I need to do is get the (?).	I-OO
A: She’s plugged in when you’re ready to download.	I-OO
G: So, what do I need here? So I'm just gonna have her back up as far as she can.	B-ATO
A: Eve why do you have to be so, just uh...	B-OO
G: Okay lets try it.	I-OO
A: Download.	I-OO
G: Downloaded	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: Oops (?)	I-OO
A: Here I’ll start working on (?).	I-OO
DBF: (?).	O
DBS: That works, come on.	O
DBA: Well now we know it has to be more in that direction	O
G: Let’s see if this works.	B-OO
DBA: I can’t believe you guys got eyes and we didn’t	O

K: Maybe we can work something with timer.	B-QS
T: When did you lose it just,	O
G: Just now.	B-OO
K: What did you lose?	I-OO
T: Did you go anywhere besides right here?	O
G: Oh go-	B-OO
K: What did you lose?	I-OO
G: My rubber band.	I-OO
T: Is this for your braces?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: (?) (color) sensor.	B-QS
K: Okay, yeah. I'm gonna try something. I really like touchscreens. Okay.	B-OO
G: That’s fine.	I-OO
T: Yeah.	O
G: I wear it all the time, some days (?).	B-OO
K: (?). Okay so we can get this out of the way, what do we do with this? How do you do like this? How do you delete a program? Okay.  Maybe I can try to make a program that instead of just doing it and then one rotation and then program and then one rotation, I can just like...	B-ATV
G: I already programmed that one.	B-OO
A: Hmm.	I-OO
K: (But how did you) program?	B-QS
A: We want to get the corn we want to, to get that thing.	B-A
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: So...	I-OO
G: I'm gonna push this in a little bit if you don’t mind.	B-D
A: Yeah and I'm just like, trying to like turn it over	I-D
G: (?) for a few minutes.	B-OO
A: Mm::: One second, I think I got it, nope.  I just gotta (?).	B-D
K: No, what’s going on, just trying...	B-QS
A: Oh I think I got it. Okay.	B-D
G: I'm hungry. What time is it? Only ten minutes.	B-OO
A: ‘til food?	I-OO
G: ‘til food.	I-OO
K: Oops sorry.	I-OO
G: I need to take that for a second after.	I-OO
K: Somebody hold this.	I-OO
G: It's not plugged in.	B-QS
K: Oh.	B-OO
G: Because I was about to take it and test it.	I-OO
A: I'm still working on the plough.	B-D
K: We don’t need anymore rotation for this.	B-ATV
G: No I'm trying to see like if it goes faster then it will go past the... Found my rubber band.	I-ATV
K: On the. Okay.	B-OO
A: Okay I think I have an idea	I-OO
G: (?) for a few minutes.	I-OO
A: Okay. I think I figured out once it's gonna do	B-D
G: Wait a minute.	B-OO
A: I figured it out.	B-D
G: What’s the fish one?	B-A
K: You take one and put it on the table and put it to base.	I-A
G: Wait a minute the fish one...wait if you bring...	I-A
A: Where’s those, oh...	B-D
G: If you bring the fish back to the base you get points.	B-A
A: Oh can I see the robot thingy me jigger, I think I figured it out. I probably didn’t.	B-D
G: Because I'm thinking if we remove the fish first I can program the fish one and I can set that one after and I, we can program that and then after we remove the fish back to the base then we can go get the blue germ one without touching the fish.  What do you think? (?) I have an idea. Can I show you my idea?	B-A
A: Hold on I think I got it.	B-D
G: Cool.	B-OO
A: Oh I did I found it, I found it.	B-D
G: We should put this...	I-D
A: Yeah that’s what I'm doing.	I-D
G: Can I take this out?, or, do you need that?	I-D
20:00 A: They’re just gonna go like that then like that and then	I-D
I’ll fix the whatever and now the thing is I got to figure out, I think if I take all of these are right, right?  That can go, can these go through here?	I-D
G: Well I was thinking for this one. We could like. Um we could have it go over, we could have it move forward, grab the fish back up and then go forward and knock the thing off.	B-A
T: Okay. So the other teams doing that fish, they’re gonna try to get the fish back to base, that’s what they’re doing.	O
G: That’s what we’re doing.	B-OO
T: Are you doing the fish?	O
G: We’re gonna try the fish one...	B-A
T: Yeah.	O
G: ...and then we’re going to try and knock the...	B-A
T: Yeah that one you’ll have to be careful because it says that the baby fish has to (?).	O
G: Yeah	B-OO
T: Yeah	O
G: So, I have an idea lets take a smaller one of this, I use two (?) take this one.	B-D
A: They don’t fit.	I-D
G: We’ll probably take the (?)...	I-D
A: If we go like that.	I-D
G: If we go like that you’ll still have room for this...	I-D
K: Hmm.	B-OO
G: ...and we don’t make this too big.	B-D
K: We’re using the plough and if (?) we can take all the fish.	I-D
A: Okay. See if we can just do those two.	I-D
G: But how do we put this on?	I-D
A: These?	I-D
G: We don’t need this.	I-D
A: Oh.	I-D
G: We could just have this as a plough.	I-D
A: (?).	O
G: (I’m just saying.) We don’t have to have this but whatever you think’s best.	B-D
T: You can choose any fish you want.	O
G: Okay?	B-OO
A: Okay, I'm just gonna try and do some things I guess. (?)	I-OO
K: Possibly this one? If it's further away from the (?).	B-A
G: (?) not doing anything (?) I'm gonna start programing something else.	B-OO
K: Wait if we can go like this we can take off the thing which...and then, and then we can go straight forward and go like this...	B-A
G: What is this? This is what I've been looking for this whole entire time, whatever, whatever.	B-D
K: Yeah, yeah, Georgie I need you for something.	B-OO
G: I'm busy right now, hold on.	I-OO
K: I still don’t know if this is like a microphone or not.	I-OO
G: Can I plug this in and then test something?	I-OO
A: Hmm, hmm I figured it out.	B-D
K: Meagan I need you for something really quickly.	B-OO
G: Hold on...what?	I-OO
K: You’re the master programmer, okay so you know how we’re gonna go like this and take this off the map?	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Okay, so what you can do is, like we’re also doing the fish right?	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: What we can do is, we can go like this, take this ba- um ball out, kind of go around this and get this fish and put it to base.	B-A
G: I was thinking either that or we do this, our thing starts here, it comes over here gets this fish brings it back goes, knocks this off the thing, comes back...	I-A
K: Yeah but that might be too much time, but that might be too much time, hmm, hmm that might be too much time because we can like go like this and like l::: an do::: and then while, if we wanna go, we can just go like that...and get this um out of the way.	I-A
G: But we have to bring the fish back to here.	I-A
K: Yeah it, it, it will (?) and while that, when we go we can probably take this and push this,	I-A
G: Okay	B-OO
K: So while, when we go we can take one piece of corn, go back to the base, hit the fish and put it back. Yeah.	B-A
G: I don’t think we’ll be able to accomplish all that.	I-A
K: Oh	B-OO
G: By the I (?). Yeah. I think our priority should be these.	B-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: So we’ll start by getting this one.	B-A
T: (?) knock both of them down (in the mission)	O
G: Yes.	B-OO
T:  So you have to make it	O
K: But we can do the fish, we can do the fish, the same thing the same time as we can do the map, the ball.	B-A
G: Oh okay, perfect so	I-A
A: And it flips up so when we don’t want it.	B-D
G: But I need to program this (?).	B-OO
K: (?)	O
A: I got it.	B-OO
G: I’ll try to (?).	I-OO
T: I like this.	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: We need to, oh what if it...well we need to kind of retract this.	B-D
A: Yeah it can go up when we don’t want it.	I-D
K: How do you, how did you program them?	B-QS
A: No when it goes back to base you can flip it.	B-D
K: Oh okay, I see where you’re going.	I-D
T: (?)	O
A: Thanks.  After three minutes of just trying to figure it out.	B-D
T: It came out very nice.	O
A: And of course Georgie helped me figure (something out).	B-OO
T: (?) and you’re doing the pollution reversal?	O
K: The, we take yeah and then the fish.	B-A
T: Okay so four points each, each part.	O
K: It will be eight points and then the fish, I don’t think we have to put it back though.	B-A
A: Is there, I think there’s a way where I can make this even simpler.	B-D
K: (Megan can I)...(because it's programing it...)	B-OO
A: I don’t think I need to join these.	B-D
K: You know, now it's touch screen	B-OO
A: Yep. That’s what I need.	B-D
K: It's just easier for you like that.	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: I can’t make the program any bigger because it won’t let me attach this.	B-QS
<General classroom noise>	O
K: (?) like that, just, (move) it over there. Hmm (interesting) oh that part. No, turn around and go like that.	B-QS
G: It's not working.	I-QS
K: Okay try it to see what we have to do (?).	I-QS
A: Hold on, hold on. And you can lift it but it just...	B-OO
K: Hmm. What should I work with? I kind of feel like the odd one out.	I-OO
A: Well that was odd. I have another plough idea.	B-D
A: Do we have one of them gold thingies no okay.	I-D
G: Okay. I need you to hold this up in the air, wait no I need this on the ground like this, just wonder how far this is gonna go, here we go.	B-OO
FAst: Girls we’re gonne break for lunch in five minutes.	O
G: Okay thank you.	B-OO
K: Okay. Yeah this needs, we need to focus this on the ground, are you done running it?	I-OO
G: Not yet I'm testing something.	I-OO
K: (?) it's somewhere in here.	I-OO
G: Move forward okay, oh I forgot to download it.	B-ATO
K: Okay.	B-OO
T: So we’re breaking for lunch in a couple of minutes.	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
G: We know.	I-OO
T: Okay.	I-OO
A: Okay now look the plough is even simpler.	B-D
K: Yeah we got this.	B-OO
A: Because simpler the better.	B-D
K: That’s true.	B-OO
MA: Do you mind if we take a peek at the batteries to see how much time you have left on the battery, nine hours, that’s great, lets me see yours?	O
G: Hold on	B-OO
MA: That’s five hours worth, thank you.	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: How does that look now?	B-D
G: Cool, I think (?).	B-OO
K: I'm testing it with you.	I-OO
G: Let’s see if this works. Wait	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh I swear if that plough...here, hold on I got it. Do you want to take the thing off?	B-DO
K: I wanna, I wanna, I want to do this (?).	B-OO
A: Go, there go, do it, do it. You stupid plough.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	B-P
G: That didn’t work, so lets try this again.	B-NSTO
A: Oops.	I-NSTO
G: One, two, three okay so that didn’t work, so we need it four rotations that way.	B-ATO
A: So... We need one up on this,	B-D
G: Let’s see so we’re going to need...	B-ATV
K: Excuse me.	B-OO
30:00 G: Four rotations.	B-ATV
K: We got to do something about that plough.	B-D
F: Turn around.	B-ATO
A: Fixing it.	B-D
G: Move forward, four rotations...turn right we need forward, forward three rotations lets try that.	B-ATV
A: Plough will be fixed in one minute.	B-D
K: Ready? Can I do it? Oh...	B-OO
A: I need the robot again.	I-OO
K: Okay so we got one	I-OO
G: Ball over.	B-DO
K: It got some fish out of the way but the, but the baby fish is gone, that’s good.	I-DO
G: So we don’t necessarily wanna focus on the fishing one right now then.	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: So...	I-OO
A: Oh I want to see that.	I-OO
G: Yeah. (?).	I-OO
K: Okay try it, try it again.	I-OO
G: Oh oops.	B-NSTO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: Oh that (?)	B-NSTO
K: That didn’t work, oh that (?) fell, we got a mission.	I-NSTO
G: Mission accomplished	I-NSTO
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: So, lets see...	I-OO
K: No it's like this...	I-OO
A: Now a  wheel’s gone on that axle.	B-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: Try it again it used to work.	I-OO
G: Well it takes four rotations to get there.	B-ATV
A: Like back a little, go back.	B-A
K: Go back and then try it again.	B-OO
A: Oh	B-NSTO
K: You hit the fish. Guys. We need something to do about that.	B-DO
A: It's gonna run it over.	I-DO
G: Yeah that’s kind of the point right now, it runs it over.	B-A
K: You got this.	B-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha	I-OO
K: The baby fish is intact.	B-DO
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: We need to do something about...	I-OO
G: So it comes down here and then it turns, so we need it to turn all the way...	B-DO
K: Ah ha. I got that	B-OO
G: ...like this and then go forward.	B-DO
K: So.	B-OO
A: I need the robot to work on the plough so other side.	B-D
K: Um you can get that and turn it into.	B-QS
M: Okay first up that we think we’re almost absolutely positive we have enough battery power in the mics for the rest of the day, so leave your mics on, don’t worry about your mic, just leave it on don’t worry about it (?).	O
K: Is that good?	B-QS
G: (?) no do four.	B-ATV
M: (?) go outside and enjoy lunch now, lunch is here	O
G: (?)	O
M: Also during lunch break you come back have a full afternoon to (?) challenges okay.  Let’s get a bite to eat (?).	O
K: Where is it?	B-OO
G: Okay lets go get food.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Hold on I wanna finish this plough first.	I-OO
G: It's lunch break.	I-OO
LUNCH BREAK	O
A: I fixed the plow!	B-D
K: Let me just stick this in.	I-D
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: Hopefully you’ll (?).	I-OO
G: Let’s take it off though	B-D
A: Yeah I turned it on?	B-QR
K: That is (?).	B-OO
G: Oh yeah okay did you download?	B-QS
A: Yeah, it will work with the plough.	B-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: Start it back now before because we have a plough now.	B-A
G: Third.	I-A
A: Sure, third with plough. Do we want the plough on or...	I-A
G: Plough on.	B-D
A: Let’s try with it on.	I-D
G: Maybe we should go like this (?). If we had enough friction it could put down.	I-D
K: Let’s try this.	B-OO
A: Wait we’re doing third right there. huh huh ha ha ha. It really likes to...likes to make a mess.	B-A
G: Let’s re-program that.	B-OO
K: It's going straight.	B-ATO
K: Can you move out the way please so I can. You program this?	B-OO
T: You guys (?) microphone’s back on.	O
K: Yeah	B-OO
G: We never took them off.	I-OO
T: Okay.	O
G: Excuse me.	B-OO
K: Oh sorry I wanted to program but okay.	I-OO
G: Let’s see the forward, forward, turn around then...	B-ATO
A: How is this gonna work?	B-A
K: Well it's kind of like let me show you come on something I wanna show you. So what I, what we do is we can like put it like this and then we (?) like push it like that	I-A

DBF: It worked so well.	O
G: Are you sure? Yeah because we accidentally broke it and then we had to fix it.	B-OO
DBA: No it was...	O
DBF: It was covering (?).	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: I'm tired.	I-OO
G: I'm making it better, oh it's trying to.	I-OO
DBF: Oh didn’t do it again. Oh okay	O
DBA: Start it (?).	O
A: Where did you go.	B-OO
DBF: Lets start it here. That works.	O
DBA: Yay, okay one more time. Sorry. This will be our last.	O
DBF: (?) mistake (just so we know it’s)	O
G: Most likely	B-OO
DBS: All the tops are falling off (?). Ow this is rubbing off on you Fiona Cant we (?) a map at the back of my evil genius list.	O
G: Well I’ve got. Diamonds rubies etcetera (?)	B-OO
K: (?) supreme book of evil (?) his home town, brownie nights (?).	I-OO
G: Running like that he goes.	I-OO
A: It does wheelies.	I-OO
DBA: Okay you guys (?).	O
G: These are better.	B-OO
A: You go right there...	B-A
G: Let’s see if this works.	B-OO
A: Click it. Please just work already. Oh my god, no, no.	B-NSTO
T: That was different	O
A: Okay then.	B-OO
K: Okay so... back	I-OO
A: We need...(?)	I-OO
G: Horrible.	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
A: Bring it down to forty.	B-ATV
?: Better than, ours not.	O
A: No a little bit more, more, like thirty seven (?).	B-ATV
G: We need to give up on our original plan to just have it, to get the blue and the yellow thing.	B-A
A: The (purple) (circle) whatever.	B-OO
G: You guys an use this table.	I-OO
A: Okay, do forty.	B-ATV
K: Forty.	I-ATV
A: Or thirty nine.	I-ATV
G: Get rid of my turn right, turn left thing it didn’t work.	B-ATO
K: Forty and then...	B-ATV
A: It's downloading, hold on, download.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Lets try that.	I-OO
K: After that, tell me how to go, how it went and then (?).	I-OO
G: Yours works really well.	I-OO
LBA: Not really. It's, that, that backing up is supposed to go there.	O
G: Well you got backing up and you have a forward you can come and get this one.	B-A
<classroom chatter>	O
G: Wow, that’s cool.  This one’s ours.	B-OO
LBS: Neat	O
A: Yeah flips up and down.	B-D
G: We didn’t use the sensor.	I-D
A: We just have eyes.	I-D
LBS: Oh I see. I like it	O
A: And like the eyes appear when we flip it down.	B-D
LBS: Cool.	O
A: Peek a boo.	B-OO
LBS: Okay we need to keep moving.	O
G: Okay let’s try this, lets bash this off.	B-OO
K: You’re on mission two?	I-OO
LBS: We have a couple of them and neither of them work.	O
K: No...oh gosh you (?).	B-OO
A: Could you just...	I-OO
K: Okay thirty seven?	B-ATV
A: No.	B-OO
K: Thirty five.	B-ATV
A: Thirty five.	I-ATV
G: I think if we were able to back it up and have it go around, it might work better.	B-A
T: (?).	O
G: Yeah because	B-OO
A: I wish it was remote like...	B-QR
T: Hey guys, guys I have an idea, I know but um...	O
K: Shall we delete this and try, try again one?	B-OO
G: I have an idea.	B-A
A: No just download it.	B-OO
K: Yeah touch just to see. And then...hey, Georgie, Georgie	I-OO
G: I have an idea find a way to get it to come around, instead of going and trying to harm the fish, find a way to have it go around.	B-A
K: Georgie I have a question.	B-OO
A: Too much.	B-DO
K: Guys, should, should I work on...oh (?). Should we do like a thirty?	B-ATV
G: When the pressure is applied...	B-A
K: Oh god what do we do?	B-OO
G: ...it pushes this back but then this goes (?).	B-A
A: Oh, no it's fine.	B-OO
T: Okay.	O
A: You can see it just moved over. Just gonna try.	B-A
K: Thirty.	B-ATV
G: Guys I think, Andi, Katie. I think we need to find a way to knock over the blue ball but instead of turning right we need to back it up and have it go around.	B-A
A: Okay lets...	B-OO
K: Why (?) waste extra time?	B-A
A: Yeah.  (Come) on let’s try it.	B-OO
G: But would you rather get all of these points.	B-A
A: Lets try this one and we’re gonna try thirty and if those two don’t work then we’re gonna start...	B-ATV
K: Okay I’m trying that. Guys, um okay.	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
DBS: It worked again.	O
<classroom chatter>	O
G: I know.	B-OO
A: Oh my t-shirt.	I-OO
A: Too much, too much of a turn, okay...	B-DO
G: Seven points.	B-OO
A: ...bump it down to twenty eight.	B-ATV
K: Okay this has messed up.	B-OO
G: If any bacteria.	B-A
A: Not it’s fine. Oh no what did you do?	B-OO
K: I didn’t do anything it just randomly (?)	I-OO
G: So we could knock over this and then we get seven points.	B-A
A: Hold on, let me see this computer.	B-OO
G: And then we, even though we wouldn’t have a ton of extra time it would be good.	B-A
A: There.	B-OO
K: It doesn’t want to cooperate.	I-OO
G: Guys it does seven points and we (?) if we did...the dispenser.	B-A
K: Should I do um, should I do another mission? Like while we’re working on this I can like focus on another one.	I-A
A: But we don’t even have one so all hands on deck. You should be...twenty seven.	B-ATV
K: Yeah lets try twenty seven.	I-ATV
A: And if this doesn’t work then we’re just gonna scratch this idea of. Eve (?)	B-OO
G: Guys I have an idea.	B-A
K: If it doesn’t work then...	I-A
G: You know what we could do?	I-A
A: Make a pole. I'm just saying.	I-A
G: Yeah make like a a claw of...if this one doesn’t work we could use this, have it out and then have it attached to the outside...	B-D
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
G: So then when it goes over it can hit it.	B-D
K: Ah hah	B-OO
G: But then I’ll make a different one just in case that one doesn’t work.	B-D
A: Okay it just needs to go more forward, I found it.	B-ATO
G: What?	B-OO
A: Give me this thing, I got it.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
20:00 G: A::h	O
K: (I’m sorry) this is not working.	O
A: Just (?).	B-OO
G: But yeah if we.	I-OO
K: I just kind of wanna work on another mission, because I don’t want only have seven points.	I-OO
G: Yeah but we’ll have seven from that and then we’ll have the four from the ball, so that’ll be eleven and then if we can program it to go and get the yellow ball then we have fifteen.	B-A
K: Still there’s like three hundred and seventy eight (seventy six).	I-A
A: Well we’ll figure it out once we perfect this, because this is a big part.	B-OO
G: I'm gonna work on making the um...arm.	B-D
K: Okay you can work on that.	B-OO
A: Do you know you can make this a tablet by flipping it?	I-OO
K: Really?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Can we do that?	I-OO
A: Yeah I guess.	I-OO
A: Okay it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. Just make it flat.	I-OO
G: This is just a touch screen computer.	I-OO
A: Boom, boom, so...and the test I last saw this was here.	B-A
DBF: Yeah. But that was for another setting we had. I think, lets try it from there, I think it was supposed to be this one was supposed to be. (?) it was over and over the ring.	O
K: I'm fixing something up is that okay?	B-OO
A: Well what are you fixing?	I-OO
K: Well right here this thing was supposed, it was out, was not there so like it would like boom boom, like boom, boom. And that might destroy the thing.	B-ATO
A: Make that thirty.	B-ATV
K: Thirty okay we got a thirty.	I-ATV
K: I need Eve.	B-OO
A: Why are you going backwards, no that’s not what you do. I found the issue.	B-DO
K: Okay what’s the issue?	B-OO
A: Okay, let me see the laptop. I found it. Here, this is easier for me.	I-OO
K: Yeah this is kind of easier.	I-OO
A: Erm...	I-OO
K: Here’s a flat surface. Kind of put it like that.  Oh yeah.	I-OO
A: You...so it goes back...	I-OO
K: Here let me help you with the arm.	B-D
A: This...where’s the...can you (plug this in?).	B-OO
K: Plugged in. Is that it?	I-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Here it is. Okay, so...	I-OO
A: Ohhhh, why? Give me the...	B-NSTO
K: Take it, wait I got to test this for a sec.	B-OO
A: Go ahead	I-OO
G: What are you doing.	I-OO
K: Can we test this?	I-OO
A: Why’s my phone vibrating? Oh. You’re not supposed to do anything. You are supposed to be...that...	I-OO
K: Change your mind <singing>.	I-OO
A: Give me the robot, I think I found it.	I-OO
K: Her names Eve Andi.	I-OO
A: It's a robot.	I-OO
K: You’re so mean. Why would a robot that doesn’t have a name try to do world domination? It’s true.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: Okay, now turn, turn, ohhh... Hold on. Oh goes forward... Give me the thing, I figured out why. We’re not even looking at it.  We’re not even looking at what’s the issue. We’re not even at it see?	B-DO
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: We’re trying to figure it out when it's all the way over here.	B-DO
K: Okay. Oh my gosh I need more coffee	B-OO
A: This...	I-OO
K: I'm gonna go and get some more coffee is that okay? No.	I-OO
A: Just wait a little.	I-OO
K: Hey I'm, I'm gonna clean our table. Oop’s sorry about that Andi.	I-OO
A: Okay	I-OO
K: Are you working on the arm?	B-D
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: You do that...where’s (?). I need to cool down a bit.	I-OO
A: Give me a minute and I’ll join you.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: (This don’t work.) I hope this works, but if it doesn’t, I don’t know.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Eve this is one of your moments of truth.	I-OO
K: Please do this.	I-OO
A: Eve if you don’t do this I don’t know what we’re gonna do.	I-OO
K: Please be nice to us for once (?).	I-OO
A: I’m so tired.  Come on Eve...There you go Eve.	B-NSTO
T: That’s so close.	B-OO
A: Come on Eve, now you gotta just go back...I can fix that air bubble. It’s waiting.	B-NSTO
K: Oh I'm sorry about that. God.	B-OO
G: Hey I made the arm.	B-A
K: I’m going to die.	B-OO
A: Okay well we have a little bit of a programming bug...no not a bug.	I-OO
G: No all we need to do...	I-OO
K: You can see why this takes people three months to accomplish.	I-OO
G: What do you think?	I-OO
A: How do you make it so it does it for a longer time?	B-ATV
K: Speed? No not speed.	I-ATV
G: I have an idea, just have it go forward to get the ball and the we can attach the arm so then we don’t have to add anything else to the program. And make it less complicated and less time.	B-A
A: That means I have to re-do this.	B-OO
G: No, this is our new one.	B-A
A: Oh...oh.	B-OO
K: I have an idea.	B-A
G: So n- you two go take coffee break.	B-OO
K: I have a really good idea.	B-A
G: You two go take a coffee break.	B-OO
A: Where’s my phone?	I-OO
G: I don’t know you just had it.	I-OO
A: Oh there it is.	I-OO
K: I have a really good idea but...	B-A
A: Coffee Break?	B-OO
K: Yeah we’ll talk it over with coffee break, start thinking.	I-OO
30:00  <general classroom noise>	O
A: There’s no more coffee.	B-OO
K: Why? Water. Sure. And cheerios. Water and Oreo.	I-OO
A: I just want oreo okay.	I-OO
<general classroom chatter>	O
A: What’s that?	B-OO
K: Okay, so I have a really good idea that probably (?) not work,	B-A
A: We have to restart.	B-OO
K: What if I kind of like the stress? Okay (?) (Sure won’t get it alone)	I-OO
<general chatter>	O
K: Oh it doesn’t work? If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. We have to try again. So anyways I have a really good idea that. That’s just the (sketch). We don’t really need that. What? God (?)it on.	B-A
?: No they’ll just bring other people back it obviously  affects your (?).	O

C: And that’s all I’m gonna explain right now you can mess around try some different things and er we can always check back (?) explain some other things later.	O
F: Do you wanna try some stuff Sarah?	B-OO
T: Hm do you guys know what you wanna go for?	O
S: Okay	B-OO
F: Um	I-OO
T: (?) rats	O
F: Oh	B-OO
T: And rats get big (?)	O
L: (Pet) (?)	B-OO
T: There’s a rat hidden somewhere and you have to find them and then bring them back to base.	O
F: Ooh!	B-OO
L: Where do you think they are do you think they can be in there like	B-A
T: You have to know where they are.	O
F: Er we can’t program the robot to look for rats	B-A
T: Ha ha use your rat sensor.	O
F: Ha huh huh.	B-OO
T: Bee bee beep bee bee bee beep	O
F: Rat detected.	B-OO
T: Detected (?)	O
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Well	I-OO
F: Do you wanna just read some of the things Sarah or?	I-OO
L: What are we looking at	I-OO
F: We’re looking for rats.	I-OO
S: Are those like (croissants)	I-OO
F: Like (old croisstants)	I-OO
S: Um (?) rat to be	I-OO
F: I don’t think we can touch anything.	I-OO
T: You must be able to touch. Oh there’s (?)	O
F: I like this thing it’s cool.	B-A
L: Um.	B-OO
T: I like the sink	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I wouldn’t push on	I-OO
F: Maybe there’s	I-OO
S: I think I’ll read over the projects.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah lets look at our different options.	B-A
S: Okay so. Ak. They have rolly things.	B-OO
F: Okay. Yes.	I-OO
S: Good	I-OO
F: So what do we have as good options.	I-OO
S: Okay pollution reversal. Corn harvest.	I-OO
F: No.	I-OO
S: Fishing. Pizza and ice cream. (?) fresh produce. (Distant) travel.	I-OO
L: Oh Sarah don’t just read the titles we need to like know	I-OO
S: Yeah but	I-OO
L: What you do for them.	I-OO
S: Okay.  I shall read pollution reversal. As first of many. No matter where pollution or (?) it usually finds it way to water and and of course all plants and  animals take in water. Since we depend on plants and animals for our food pollution is a source of contamination. Not just in what we breathe and drink. But also what we eat. Yellow and blue balls represent pesticides on farms and heavy metals in water. While on rings they are off the mat. Balls touching mat are worth four points each.	I-OO
F: Alright let’s underline the parts that are important. I bet we’re allowed to write I hope we're allowed to write on this.	B-A
L: Why don’t you guys think about that and I’ll keep on building.	I-A
F: Okay so.	B-OO
L: Does that sound good? I’ll take that as a yes. Okay.	I-OO
S: (?) us a plough.	B-D
F: Okay corn harvest. Okay	B-OO
S: Harvest. A harvester	I-OO
F: We don’t need to read the actual story. It’s going (?) about food.	I-OO
T: huh huh huh	O
L: We already learned about food we’re (cooking) people.	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
S: Okay (?) (fish). Fish can be frozen immediately after being caught	I-OO
T: (?) fish are worth three if the baby fish is still touching the (?) I think you might wanna be standing over here so that you can (?)	O
F: Yeah. Let’s look.	B-A
L: I (?) build stuff they’re going to. Uh it looks like we have more to make.	B-OO
F: Alright pizza and ice cream those ones are worth seven points	I-OO
L: (What it is yes)	I-OO
F: The pizza and ice cream yeah if you pick them up or push them	B-A
L: Yeah it is cos	B-OO
F: If they’re we could either have like a claw or even a machine could	B-A
L: Oh we don’t oh	B-OO
F: Pull some or a thing that pushes something too. That one shouldn’t be too hard I don’t think.	B-A
L: Oh we don’t get to get (?)	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: And then farm fresh produce so er to get the if you get the yellow truck in base it’s worth nine points	B-OO
S: Wait what is it?	I-OO
F: If you get the yellow truck into the base it’s worth nine points. Remember rule twenty three what does that mean	I-OO
T: I know what rule twenty three I’ll find out.	O
F: Yeah. Alright cooking time the white p- er the white pointer in the red zone is worth fourteen points so if we build a machine that can get it to go around into the red part then it’s worth er fourteen points so that coud be a cool one to do. If we could figure out how to do it.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: We’d just need to make it like specifically go in a certain circle.	B-A
S: Which one was that?	I-A
F: This one	I-A
S: Okay. No (?) Um then we’ve got (?) mission groceries	I-A
F: Wait lets keep reading the ones on this page. We haven’t read all of them. Er we don’t need to like actually read about them. Er thermometer spindle click slash drop fully showing the low red temperature is worth twenty points.	B-OO
S: Mm	I-OO
F: Which on is that? That’s the thermometer thing? That’s a  lot of points. That’s cool. Er this one doesn’t exist. Next refrigerated ground transport. Blah blah blah blah blah. Er I know okay er the trailer in base is worth twelve points.	B-A
L: What do you do to it.	I-A
S: Well you probably have to hook it.	I-A
F: Er to get to move it into base	I-A
T: I know what rule twenty three is if you decide	O
F: Okay. Wh- what is rule twenty three.	B-OO
T: It means that	O
L: Oh don’t push on the (?)	B-OO
T: your vehicle	O
L: Okay there we go	B-OO
T: needs to be at the (east well) at the end of the minute it can’t like get to the wall and then leave. It needs to be there.	O
F: Wait where	B-A
T: On the ea- on that thing where it the robot touching the east wall	O
F: Oh the east wall okay. So it needs to be touch-	B-A
T: I don’t see any directions on here	O
F: Okay I see it here	B-A
S: East wall	I-A
F: It’s north south east west. Okay so.  Refrigerated ground transport er getting the trailer in the base is worth twelve points. Er the trailer with meat inside and no germs inside with any of its wheels I don’t think it has any meat I don’t think there is any meat	I-A
L: (Why’s this moving?)	B-OO
F: It has wheels I think	I-OO
S: Oh yeah	I-OO
L: Oh yeah okay	I-OO
F: Um alright. So if this thing was cool	B-A
L: Which one.	B-OO
F: Um. Empty dispensers are worth twelve points each if no so. And so Lyn emptying this out hey you’re stepping on my shoe.	I-OO
S: Oh. Ack!	I-OO
F: It’s okay. Er.	I-OO
S: I’m sorry.	I-OO
F: Those things emptied out are worth twelve points if we can get the bacteria all of the bacteria into the base. Each of them are worth twelve points or seven points if we don’t. So if we got all the bacteria out of those it would be twenty eight points.	B-A
L: Okay so that would probably be like the first one to go for.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: In like this one.	B-A
F: Yeah. Um	B-OO
00:00  <general classroom noise>	O
L: ...okay...so yeah we should probably do that one	B-A
F: alright	B-OO
L: The disinfect one...	B-A
S: Do you want to start programming that one?	B-OO
F: I think a cool one could also be figuring out how to make this turn around.	B-A
L: So we yeah lets start by working on those two.	B-OO
S: Wait, we could do that (?) (shovel) the (?)	B-A
F: Yeah, yeah. Yeah that’s what we were thinking of, but at least figuring how to dump them first.	I-A
S: Um okay so you circle round once then you (start) (?)  the plough to go in then you do the same as (?).	I-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Those ones.	B-A
L: Okay, so...	B-OO
S: See what I mean?	B-A
F: Yeah	B-OO
T: Can you combine a couple of challenges to get more points like could you get	O
F: I think you can do multiple ones	B-A
T: You could get bacteria (?)	O
F: But there’s a time limit.	B-A
T: Right	O
A: And like she was saying be very careful about having too many missions	O
L: Right	B-OO
A: Because what if if something happens during the first one then the rest of them won’t work either so	O
F: Yeah. Okay	B-OO
A:  Work work with you know think about that too, I mean should you wanna have (?).	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
A: You  gotta (?) program (?).	O
T: Like a um (?) like at the beginning of (?) when they make toast (?)	O
F: (Revolver) machine?	B-OO
D: (Revolver device) right	O
F: I love that.	B-OO
T: (?)	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: We got to make those at, some of those at school one time, it was so cool.	I-OO
S: Okay, lets figure out how to do the...	B-A
L: Okay. Okay. Lets plug in	B-QR
F: Alright.	I-QR
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Oh (drat) Okay.	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
L: Right, so are you guys ready?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: So if we want to do the first bacteria one you have to go straight forward and then we have to turn to the left and then of course we have to back up and back up again.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Back into base. Are we gonna try the plough then?	B-D
F: I'm not sure, I think that a good goal would just be to be able to knock them over at first since we don’t really know very much about the programing anyway. Um	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: But if we can make a plough that like pushes them back in that would be cool.	B-D
L: Alright well lets set it up now. Right. Fiona.	B-QS
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Are you doing (computering) this (program)	I-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: So you need moving forward, probably twice.	B-ATO
F: Alright so which one would that be?  large motor moves steering, large motor right?	B-QS
L: Yeah. Okay (Play it then). Okay.	B-OO
F: Can you do can we do...both of those?	B-QS
L: No I think there was a different one for that.	I-QS
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Maybe it was move tank probably. Yeah	B-ATO
F: Alright let’s figure out what this actually does, do you want to like put it on the floor or something?	B-OO
L: Sure	I-OO
F: See if, how it actually moves?	B-DO
L: Okay, so go ahead and play that?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure, okay so this is just the default setting, so it just goes forward.	B-DO
L: Okay, we should have that twice I think.	B-ATV
F: Yeah, I think that you can actually, you can make the rotations you can make it to have two rotations.	I-ATV
L: Okay lets try that.	B-OO
F: So...cool.	B-NSTO
L: Yeah okay and now we want to have one, so...this one I think?	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah okay and we want that to be C I think. Ah	B-ATV
F: I didn’t mess everything up, crumbs.	B-OO
L: Okay, so go ahead, wait, okay go ahead. Yes.	B-NSTO
F: That’s cool, lets see if we can change it by changing the power,	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Like how much of a turn we can make it do, so it started off at fifty and now this is sixty two.	B-ATV
L: Okay, hold on Sarah	B-OO
S: Hm?	I-OO
L: Is there something that you want to do to help? Do you want to help Fiona with the programing?	I-OO
F: Yeah because it would be good for all of us to be doing stuff.	I-OO
S: Im trying to think of what we, how we’re circling around this.	B-A
: Alright,	O
S: So	B-OO
F: how about you look at the thing and like strategize about what we would do. That could be helpful.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: While we fiddle around with computery stuff.	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Hmm.	I-OO
L: Can we rotate it anymore?	B-ATV
S: Wait we’re doing bacteria one right?	B-A
L: Yeah the first (one).	I-A
F: Can we do one point five?	B-ATV
L: I think...	B-OO
F: Is that a point number?	B-ATV
L: This one, I do to um get (?)	B-OO
S: So it circling (?).	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Okay, I'm gonna set the power back down to default (?).	B-ATV
S: I'm not using it I'm just strategizing okay?	B-A
F: Okay I'm gonna write fifty and then...	B-ATV
S: Are you sure we need to move forward twice or only once?	I-ATV
F: No I...	B-OO
L: Think twice because...oh that’s good a little bit less.	B-ATV
S: Okay we can make the rotations, I think we can even do quarter revolutions, that’s pretty cool it seems like a valid number for it.	I-ATV
L: Yeah that’s perfect.	B-DO
F: That’s like turning perpendicularly	I-DO
L: Okay and now we need another one of these, I think this time only one of them.	B-ATO
F: Wait, what that’s moved steering (?).	I-ATO
S: Okay then you go forward and you move back to the base and you repeat it all.	I-ATO
F: Oh one of	B-OO
L: Wait no	I-OO
F: Yeah. There are different settings for the play thing where there’s like a loop thing, there’s a switch thing and there’s a loop (?). It’s kinda interesting	B-QS
L: (Fiona go ahead)	B-OO
F: Okay, er okay this is just with the tank thing at the regular.	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Setting.	I-OO
L: Can you do that again?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: You know (?).	I-OO
F: Shall I try it with one point five or something.	B-ATV
S: Okay you want it to do that but then you want it to turn around and move and back around.	B-ATO
L: Yeah we need to back as well, but...	I-ATO
F: Great	B-OO
S: Because of you reverse you’re just gonna scatter them you want them all to dump and then you wanna circle round and scrape them all up.	B-A
F: Alright so we can do one of these words like that, alright lets try this...	B-ATO
F: Okay we can change the direction.	I-ATO
L: Why did you turn that again (?).	I-ATO
F: I thought we were going to try to loop around it or something?	B-A
L: Well (?).	B-OO
S: No, no you wanna loop around, okay so um	B-A
F: Alright what have we already done, lets...	B-DO
S: This is the bacteria this is the truck. Okay starts here, it goes round this way. Okay bacteria (would be a bit smaller but,) then it hits the (handle). You want it to turn around this way to go here, move round the sides pick it up again and then go, because if you reverse it's just gonna scatter them everywhere pretty much.	B-A
F: Okay, so what’s the next step? We’ve already made. Sarah do you wanna watch what it does already? So that you can know what’s going on. So it already goes like that.	B-OO
S: Yeah and then you wanna turn it the C wheel again.	B-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
F: No but that’s going to run into the lever because say (?).	B-A
S: Yeah but you want it to run into the lever.	I-A
L: No it's already (?).	B-OO
F: (?) Yeah. We want it to go off once.	B-A
L: Because see we push it like that and it moves and this all dumps but then it we continue to turn this (?) (in the lever)...see.	I-A
F: So you want it, wait, alright lets, lets see what we, lets just er...	I-A
L: So we have...	I-A
F: ...(?) it going?	I-A
L: Let’s say we start here that’s (in there, in there) (?). Okay and we all go.	I-A
F: And then we wanna have it make a full turn and sweep them up	I-A
L: Yeah, yeah...(?) seems right yeah?	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
T: (?)	O
F: Ha ha	B-OO
L: Ooh	I-OO
F: Alright so right now we have the first part now we just want to make it turn fully right?	B-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright so we want to make it have a full turn right?	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So I think we do that with this and have like one of it.	B-ATO
L: Wanna see what it does so far?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Ignore the last part of it though.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: That would be with the C thing, but we’ll, we’ll make it do like (?)...	B-ATV
L: Mama. Wanna what it does?	B-OO
T: What what? Do I wanna see what it does?	O
L: Yeah. Okay, well (?)how far we can turn for this right.	B-ATO
F: Right	B-OO
F: That’s gonna turn all the way round  though.	B-ATO
T: (?) (the measurement) already?	O
F: Um we’re going to just try out the different motions and then tweak the measurements from there I think, just so we’re know what we’re going to do before we, I think we’ll be more like (?).	B-A
L: Hey er Sarah though can you watch this because I have to go to the bathroom.	B-OO
F: Right so can you sit in Lyn’s seat maybe and watch the robot thing?	I-OO
L: Okay (?).	I-OO
T: Okay honey don’t forget to leave that (?) I’m sorry sweetie.	O
S: So full circulation for the (last motion).	B-ATO
F: Yeah	B-OO
S: Yeah and then you move it forward and bring it back in,	B-ATO
F: Okay...do you want to try out what we have so far?	B-OO
S: Hmm?	I-OO
F: Do you wanna try out what we have so far on the thing?	I-OO
S: Okay. How (?) loaded onto (?)	B-QS
F: Um we have it plugged in so I think that we...(?).	I-QS
S: You already renamed it.	I-QS
F: I know but I'm gonna name it Banbury cheese underscore bacteria, alright now I'm gonna download it...I think it's downloaded, so there we go we have a new Banbury cheese so we could, er I think it's that one. And I think we can unplug it and still play this program. Alright, lets try it.	I-QS
S: (Fine)	B-OO
F: We’ll definitely have to change the measurements and everything but...	B-A
S: Okay, I say we start right here.	I-A
F: Alright.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: Okay it's too close.	B-DO
F: Alright.	B-OO
S: Hmm.	I-OO
F: We could have it go...no.	B-NSTO
S: Ach it (dams)	I-NSTO

K: What we can do is (?). I need oh wait I’ll be right back. Georgie this has to be (?) we've got thirty minutes left	B-OO
G: No.	I-OO
K: Okay, okay.	I-OO
G: Well thank you we’ve thirty minutes left and you’re not even in here.	I-OO
K: I was thinking kind of... (?), okay, okay so, okay this kind of like that, I was thinking maybe we can just go straight...	B-A
G: This isn’t gonna work anyway. It’s not long enough. I can tell.	I-A
K: Go back right to the base all like, right through the	I-A
G: (?).	O
G: That worked so great.	B-NSTO
K: And then, okay, no wait, wait, wait, so that was our like original (?).	B-A
<laughing>	O
G: Thank you guys.	B-OO
K: God I'm never gonna finish this. Okay so.	I-OO
MT: So when, when you started it (?) right?	O
G: I try to yeah.	B-A
T: Taking a little break.	O
G: Again? Only thirty minutes left, trying this again.	B-OO
K: Okay so this, this (?). We can do... Here. What?	I-OO
A: Is yours on?	I-OO
K: Okay. Usually	I-OO
A: Did you ever turn back on your microphone?	I-OO
K: (?)  Okay. Instead of going straight, well we can go straight.	B-A
LBF: That kind of, sort of works.	O
G: That worked pretty well.	B-OO
K: (?) and on. So...	O
A: When we go straight? We’ll also (hit) this, knock over the ball it will hit this fish.	B-A
K: No, wait, maybe what we can do is if that doesn’t work then you could take it off. Cos it can go like this	I-A
A: But it will work.	I-A
K: We, we’re gonna stop right at the end of the (?), this will be a a left, go left and then...	I-A
A: Forward.	I-A
K: ...straight, yeah forward.	I-A
A: Then a right.	I-A
K: Then a right, backwards. And then we don’t even care about the fish.	I-A
A: Why don’t we hit it?	I-A
K: We’ll probably hit it anways. We don’t care about the fish, we will just go like this, once we go forward...	I-A
A: Right (?).	I-A
K: Go right like that. And then go backward.	I-A
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
K: Like right here and kind of hit like that.	B-A
A: And then hit the (?).	I-A
K: No not the (?), it’s way too much (?)	I-A
A: Just do what we have (?).	I-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: So hurry up.	I-OO
K: Just give (five).	I-OO
A: Because we’re almost	I-OO
LBT: Are you a (?)	O
G: No	B-OO
LBT: I thought you were	O
A: The problem is...	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: ...we’ve been saying almost this whole entire time.	I-OO
MT: So the first thing is that you have the ball and you put in there.	O
K: (?)	O
MT: This goes actually right in the hole. Okay. No p- p- I’m just asking	O
K: (?) stick onwards if you (?)	B-OO
A: I know	I-OO
T: (We ought) to find your team mates.	O
G: Thanks.	B-OO
K: So we can do that.	I-OO
T: What are you doing?	O
K: We’re making up a new um idea (?).	B-OO
T: Okay, so you guys were like taking a break from your work?	O
A: Yeah	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
T: I see.	O
K: Relaxation. Okay, okay Georgie we’ve got an idea.	B-A
G: Oh I already figured something out.	B-OO
K: Oh really.	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works?	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works.	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works.	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh can I see?	I-OO
K: Did it work more than twice.	I-OO
G: It worked more than twice. Not exactly how I wanted it but it still works.	I-OO
K: Georgie. Group hug. (Doing so good)	I-OO
A: Hold on (watch this).	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
A: Okay so I need.	I-OO
K: How old are you guys?	I-OO
GTS: Nine.	O
K: Oh. That’s cool.	B-OO
GTS: (?) seven.	O
K: Oh wow.	B-OO
A: That’s good if it works, it works.	I-OO
G: Yeah it works.	I-OO
A: Okay then we need to add a left turn after this if it works.	B-ATO
G: I'm not adding anything else.	I-ATO
A: That’s just gonna be it?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: We’re not doing the yellows?	B-A
G: No.	B-OO
K: What? We have to like...	I-OO
G: You don’t have to.	I-OO
K: (?) the mission book?	B-A
G: It says as many as you can, it doesn’t say you have to get both the yellow and the blue ball.	I-A
A: Well if we can, we...well if this works and we (?) perfected it. Then we can add more, but right now nothing is going on.	I-A
<general classroom noise>	O
T: So what’s the big arm thing?	O
G: It's going to push the thing and have it out.	B-A
T: Okay	O
G: And it's just gonna push the thing, it's just not long enough and I need to make it like able to push something.	B-A
T: Okay.	B-OO
A: Can I go and try it now?	I-OO
G: Hold on.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: I can’t believe that it works.	B-OO
K: I can see if I can do something else.	I-OO
A: No don’t touch it, because if it works then we don’t want to touch a single thing.	I-OO
G: Wonder if this will work.	B-D
K: Okay lets try this.	B-OO
G: This isn’t staying up, I need something else in it.	B-D
A: Oh, I got it.	I-D
K: Wow yours is not Eve. Theirs is not Eve.	B-OO
T: Yeah.	O
G: There we go, now it doesn’t bend.	B-D
K: Ours, Eve is basically like going through the path of destruction.	B-OO
G: Here I have an idea.	B-D
K: Exactly. Yeah.	B-OO
40:00 G: There we go.	B-D
A: Do you want a connection piece or	I-D
G: No this will work.	I-D
A: Wait is it high enough?	I-D
G: I think so yeah.	I-D
A: You should trust that...	I-D
((classroom chatter))	O
DBT: We'll be done in just a second.	O
((classroom chatter))	O
DBS: Okay all yours	O
G: Thank you	B-OO
A: So we’re here (?) Or (unless you did another) of differently or	B-A
G: That’s perfect	I-A
K: Wait, my gosh, where, where is this?	B-OO
K: Was this our claw?	B-D
G: Yes (?) Can you get me two little pieces that like the, block things?	I-D
K: Got it. They’re not big. They’ll, they’ll do.	I-D
G: Thank you.	B-OO
K: Let me do this.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
K: Okay (?)	B-OO
A: Guys	I-OO
K: Yeah, what.	I-OO
M: This is just a ten minute warning.	O
K: Oh my god.	B-OO
A: We have nothing	I-OO
K: Oh no. No, no, no, no... This cant be happening.	I-OO
A: We have a robot...that isn’t programmed.	I-OO
G: It is programmed.	I-OO
A: I'm joking, I’m being dramatic.	I-OO
G: Ah	I-OO
K: It needs to be longer.	B-D
A: I can fix that,	B-OO
K: We can fix this.	I-OO
K: Let me go again, let me try it again.	I-OO
PR: Can I take a picture of your construction?	O
K: Sure.	B-OO
G: We (?) oh here we go.	I-OO
A: Hold on I can fix it.	I-OO
K: Yeah you can make that longer. More force, we need more force.	B-ATV
A: You go like that...	B-OO
K: Force force force force force force force	I-OO
A: Let’s try this. I need another one.	B-D
G: No we’re good, this is as long as we shall get.	I-D
A: Just put it back one.	I-D
K: It needs more force.	B-ATV
PR: Let me just take a photo before you start it off okay.	O
G: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
A: Is that outside the...	B-A
PR: Let me take a photo.	O
A: No I just got to put this in there, so it...	B-D
G: Okay. I got it.	B-OO
A: You have to start it on the other way, it wont go through or even just, like that...	I-OO
A: Oh, oh. Oh no, no, no, no...	B-NSTO
K: We’re not working on the fish.	B-A
A: We can’t hit this one.	I-A
K: Yeah but it's not a fish.	I-A
G: Will it take points off if we hit it? If we’re not doing that one?	I-A
K: What, what if, what if we’re not working on the fish.	I-A
PR: Well then you shouldn’t touch the fish, right if you touch something you’re not working on you get (?). If they move the fish when they’re not trying to move the fish does it count against them.	O
M: Only if they move the baby fish.	O
A: Okay, okay. Lets take the points off.	B-A
K: Uh so close, more force. I got this, we need more speed.	B-DO
G: We need more speed for this.	I-DO
K: Okay, speed, speed, speed is this, is six alright?	B-ATV
<singing>	O
K: Is six alright?	B-ATV
G: What?	B-OO
K: Is six alright?	B-ATV
G: Six? Sure I guess.	I-ATV
K: No let me try seven I wanted this to be extremely fast.	I-ATV
A: Do what you gotta do. Here let me put that back on there.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: No we shouldn’t have that.	I-OO
K: Program it, program it.	I-OO
G: It works better without it.	B-D
K: We're about to program	B-OO
A: But it looks cool.	I-OO
K: Come on we can do this.	I-OO
A: Well we can focus it on the end. Woh...	I-OO
K: Woah that’s awesome.	I-OO
GTS: What happened? What, what went wrong?	O
GTP: I don’t know.	O
<general classroom chatter>	O
K: Does it need to get back to base?	B-A
GTS: No, we no (?).	O
M: (?) bacteria you have to go back to base so, but it’s worth it to do that. Cos you got a lot done and you (?)	O
No big deal.	O
G: No (does zero have to go back to home base again?)	B-A
M: Or you call time (?) and leave it there.	O
G: Alright.	B-OO
M: That’s the other option.	I-OO
GS: We actually are trying to get it to the corn so...	O
M: So if you’re still trying to do another mission then you can’t call time and you’d want to pull it back to base because it's worth it.  It's worth the (?).	O
GS: (?)	O
M: Looks like that combine harvester is the problem.	O
G: We should get points for knocking out the thing right? Okay.	B-A
M: A model that’s been run over.	O
K: Hm mm mm. Eve...	B-OO
MT: Nobody knows how that happened.	O
A: (Sure) It's all good.	B-OO
K: Come on we have to go back...urgghh.	B-DO
A: Wait why wont it go?	B-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: Because it's going the wrong way.	B-DO
M: That’s a really long attachment I didn’t notice that the whole thing fits in base.	O
<sound of clapping>	O
G: (?)	O
A: Yeah when you push it it won’t go.	B-DO
K: It will go but not...	I-DO
DBT: It has to go that way.	O
K: Do like that.	B-OO
K: No we don’t have the (?) we can’t do this in ten minutes. Wait I think we can.	I-OO
A: Wait it's supposed to go that way.	B-A
DBT: Yeah.	O
M: Does your arm need to be that long for any reason? Could you use (?).	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
: I mean you’d need to change your program possibly but it's (?) I don’t know if functionally there is a reason for your arm being that long.	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Yeah we were trying to knock over the blue ball but also hit the arm	B-A
M: Yeah.	O
G: Without...	B-OO
M: Just drive closer to it?	O
A: No.	B-OO
M: No, I don’t know I just thought it would make it easier to fit in it base so... (?) Ah there you go.	O
G: That works.	B-NSTO
K: I'm programming it in order for it to turn like around in a circle.	B-OO
A: Looks like we gotta go do the thing we didn’t wanna but we have to do it. Where it has to go around.	B-A
G: Hmm.	B-OO
A: That’s what... We have a little bit of time I guess.	I-OO
M: It didn’t fall down that time. Woo it did.	O
K: I'm changing it, I'm changing it...	B-OO
G: Go ahead	I-OO
K: I'm changing it don’t worry, I got this.	I-OO
A: Ooohhh.	I-OO
G: Thank you.	I-OO
K: I'm getting this, I'm getting there, I'm kind of using my idea.	I-OO
A: We have fifteen minutes.	I-OO
K: Oh my god that can’t be...	I-OO
A: We don’t have time for this.	I-OO
K: We, we had to have time. We can do this, I know we can.	I-OO
Okay. Georgie work on the arm.	B-D
G: What (if w do) this? What if we do this? Where we have it leaning up against each other and then when it runs into something it falls over and then when it backs up.	I-D
K: Okay I'm gonna try something.	B-OO
G: It’ll be attached.	B-D
A: Try it I mean.	B-OO
K: Plug it in and see how it works.	I-OO
A: Hold on, trial, hold on we got a trial and error.	I-OO
M: Two more minutes	O
K: What? No we can’t do that, it cant happen. (?) mad at you now.	B-OO
G: yes	I-OO
K: Try it again, try it again, try it again.	I-OO
50:00 A: Fix the fish in the ball.	I-OO
K: Okay go...	I-OO
A: This is supposed to be there.	B-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: With that stupid fish. Why do you...I need more towards me.	B-A
K: Okay. And then um it’ll still be like.	B-OO
G: Here we go, ready? Lets try this.	B-A
A: It's gonna hit the baby fish. Maybe that’s what we want, maybe we want it to hit the baby fish and just take the points.	I-A
G: Here move it over a little bit. (?) quickly	I-A
A: (?)	O
G: Reset it. Ready?	B-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
G: Yeah we need to hit the baby fish for it to work.	B-A
A: Oh...	B-OO
G: Wait, lets try this one more time.	I-OO
K: Please try it because then I would have, I like to have another (?)	I-OO
G: It worked.	I-OO
K: It worked Please don’t, don’t, don’t,	B-NSTO
A: You got this. Go go go.	B-OO
K: Eve, Eve, Eve.	I-OO
A: I see why...it's try an- You see this thing, put it like this because last time it grabbed it and pulled it.  Put them all back.	I-OO
K: There it, it's not that hard to just pull the lever.	I-OO
A: When you’re using a robot it is.	I-OO
K: If all the other robots can do it you can do it to. Even though you are um a robot made for destruction. Don’t (?)...	I-OO
A: There we go.	B-NSTO
K: Yeah but that’s the baby fish. We can’t do the baby fish.	B-A
A: Well how much are the points, now if it's not that bad...	I-A
G: I’ll give up points just so we can do that.	I-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: It works we’re good.	B-NSTO
K: I killed the baby fish.	B-A
A: It's okay (?).	B-OO
G: So this is down like this right and this was angled up slightly and that was angled up like that. How much time do we have like thirty seconds.	B-A
M: Well I told everybody to take there last turn, did you have a turn?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: No.	I-OO
G: Then yeah, well let them finish.	I-OO
A: I think we’re done.	I-OO
M: You think you’re done?	O
K: (Why have they got blue) (?)	B-OO
K: So er. Careful your thing’s caught	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
T: So how are we looking?	O
A: Okay.	B-OO
G: It was great.	I-OO
T: Yeah? (?) good?	O
A: Here can you put this in (?)	B-OO
K: Like how much, points do w lose	I-OO
A: Er pretty cool.	B-D
G: It looks cool but it will block the arm from working.	I-D
A: Oh it will? Ohhhh, we’re not ready.	I-D

S: It has to be lined up like exactly.	B-A
L: Yeah I see.	I-A
S: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Did Sarah leave that on my head?	I-OO
T: Yeah I thought you knew she had.	O
F: Are you figuring out where to start it?	B-A
L: Kinda	I-A
F: Alright, where the- e::r	B-OO
S: Now it's gonna hit.	B-DO
F: Start it further forward probably.	B-A
L: No that wont.	B-NSTO
F: Alright do you wanna write down where that is?	B-A
L: No I’ll remember. Okay.	I-A
F: I wish there was a stop button.	B-QR
S: Stop it, stop it, stop it.	B-OO
L: There might be.	B-QR
F: Oh.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay, alright do you want me to...	I-OO
L: Sure, well I mean if you want, but I've kind of got it.	I-OO
S: Okay um...	I-OO
T: You can also slide it along (?).	O
S: We’re almost there, we’re almost there, no, no, no, no.	B-NSTO
L: Okay, so forward a little bit more okay.	B-DO
F: Okay you can press this I think and that stops it.	B-QR
L: I'm just...	B-OO
F: Alright one, two, three, four, five, six and, and at the front yeah or at the first tick mark six and one.	B-A
S: Does it matter if you hit that fish.	I-A
F: No it...	B-OO
L: No it does, two, three, four, five, six one (?).	B-A
L: I don’t know if we can...	B-OO
F: Oh wait it should be...	B-A
GTS: Yeah Sally it's about...	O
L: Okay, well that is something.	B-NSTO
S: How did you get it over here before?	B-DO
T: Sarah (?).	O
S: I know but how did we get it over here before?	B-DO
L: Oh.	B-OO
F: Oh it was because the fish knocked it off.	B-A
L: Can you fix the pizza?	I-A
S: Sure.	B-P
F: Do you wanna (no okay). Okay.	I-P
L: No, no leave it leave it	I-P
F: No it's gonna, it was gonna be off again and that’s what it did last time too and it messed it up.	B-DO
L: Alright.	B-OO
F: Yeah and it's not working.	B-NSTO
L: Well that was something.	I-NSTO
DGS: Where’s the table with the flowers on.	O
F: I don’t know.	B-OO
S: Huh?	I-OO
F: The table with the flower.	B-A
S: I'm not, I'm not sure.	B-OO
T: Food in base and you have to deliver it to the table.	O
S: Oh that’s makes sense.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
T: (French bread and).	O
F: (?) way. Okay.	B-OO
T: (?) figure that out, wow.	O
F: We have fifteen minutes.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Three thirty I think (not even gonna look). Oh yeah, (?) three forty five, so we still have time.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
T: (?) do it right?	O
L: What?	B-OO
T: (?).	O
L: Clears what? Just goes to the back wall.	B-A
T: (Do you think you’ve got) (?)	O
L: I don’t know.	B-OO
F: I think we need to start it further forward.	B-A
L: Well lets see what this  one does.	B-OO
F: Yeah it's gonna turn into there.	B-DO
L: Oh yeah.	B-NSTO
F: Before it.	B-DO
L: Okay so how about this?	B-OO
F: Line it up with that.	B-A
L: Yeah there we go.	I-A
S: I think we’re nearly done.	B-OO
L: Well we have to actually get it to go, no...	I-OO
L: Yeah further forward.	B-ATO
F: Stop okay.	B-OO
L: Try it there.	B-A
F: Oh yeah, you should line up the tire with that and this with the top of the M.	I-A
L: Yeah	B-OO
L: Er forward a little bit more.	B-ATV
F: Oh sorry.	B-OO
X: That’s okay.	I-OO
F: Alright so the tire’s at the second one and not at the like the fourth one. Yeah that’s (?). Can’t hit the fish.	B-A
L: Okay it needs to be back a little bit. Yeah over (?)	I-A
F: And over this way a little bit?	I-A
L: Yeah sure.	B-OO
F: No	I-OO
LGS: Yours is not (?).	O
F: Huh	B-OO
LGS: Theirs is not (?).	O
L: Fiona do you wanna like stand over there to catch it if we get stuck (?).	B-OO
F: How do we scooch it over this way?	B-A
L: I know but do you want (?).	B-OO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: I think that we should...	I-OO
S: We’ve done it before, what are we messing up on?	B-NSTO
F: We should scooch it over more, no not in that way, I think that if it goes that way then it can’t, yeah we can scooch it back but it has to be closer to this side.	B-A
L: But if we scooch it back it hits that thing.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Wait... Oh okay over a little bit?	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: We’ll be done in just a second I think.	I-OO
S: I think we’re nearly there.	I-OO
F: Yeah we just (?).	I-OO
L: No.	B-NSTO
F: Oh no.	I-NSTO
L: Okay.	I-NSTO
T: (?)	O
S: Okay all yours.	B-OO
T: (?) on the desk	O
L: Right.	B-OO
F: We didn’t add anything on to it on the outside but...	B-D
S: Do you have any rubber bands left, we could tuck the wires in.	I-D
T: Yes. I have (?)	O
L: I actually, no I don’t have it on my wrist anymore.	B-OO
S: Oh here’s one.	I-OO
F: Because I think the wires are bumping into some stuff.	B-D
S: Wait wait wait, take it off, take it off.	I-D
L: Okay	B-OO
X: We also got some people using Velcro.	O
F: Oh.	B-OO
L: Don’t know if this getting...	I-OO
S: So we just gonna park it against the back wall and call it done.	B-A
F: Yeah, probably.	B-OO
M: This is just a ten minute warning, we’re gonna stop at	O
three thirty.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Oh no. We got so much to do.	I-OO
M: But the day also needs to end	O
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Oh.	B-NSTO
L: Okay over a little bit, Fiona (get) (?).	B-A
F: Oh thanks.	B-OO
L: Thank you. Do you want to stand up there again?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Fiona what if we shorten the distance?	B-ATV
F: There?	B-OO
L: Do you wanna switch the distance.	B-ATV
F: Alright but we have to keep the starting point consistent.	B-A
L: Yeah, yeah I know where the starting point is, we just (?).	I-A
F: Right lets try that one more time just to see that the distance is the only problem. No.	B-ATV
L: It didn’t hit the fish before.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Alright we’re have to make sure it's really lined up.	B-A
L: Looking good. Okay	I-A
L: Yeah that’s what we need. Okay.	B-NSTO
T: Getting excited Sarah, I'm getting excited.	O
S: Okay	B-OO
T: Whooo, whoooohooo you’re so cool.	O
F: Lyn can you come back for a second?	B-OO
L: Hold on I’m (?) hold this, can Sarah help you with that?	I-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
S: Okay so	I-OO
F: No	I-OO
S: ...(?) could shrink the distance it goes.	B-ATV
T: (?).	O
F: (?)	O
S: No.	B-OO
F: I think it was this one, I think this one...	B-ATO
L: Not letting go of this	B-OO
F: Point four.	B-ATV
L: Okay go ahead.	B-OO
F: Okay. Yeah.Yeah.	I-OO
L: Is that corner (?).	I-OO
S: Oh come on we need to test it.	I-OO
L: Okay I don’t know if the (sharp end) will stay in this, oh wrong side, huh that’s (?)	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: I've been told you’re not allowed to (er put those down there).	O
F: Yeah we’re not allowed to put them down, but I think, but we’re just drawing (?).Banbury two	B-OO
L: Yeah just check the distance	B-A
F: Ah, it needs to be a little shorter.	B-ATV
S: Okay so (?).	B-OO
L: Okay	I-OO
F: Okay so (?) one. I think I changed. I might have changed...	B-ATO
L: Okay well it was good except we need to (?).	B-DO
S: Which spot is it?	B-A
F: It's the one that says two point four.	B-ATV
S: So...	B-OO
F: It could be like two.	B-ATV
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Okay. Er	B-OO
S: Okay we’re done	I-OO
L: Okay, do you wanna go up.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Oh...	I-OO
S: Come on you can get to the finish.	B-NSTO
F: Oh it's breaking it.	B-OO
<Sound of clapping>	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
DGT: That was really good though.	O
L: We need to switch that, okay.	B-ATO
S: So maybe two point two?	B-ATV
L: Okay can you...	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: ...no the distance there’s fine we need to just...	B-ATV
F: What do we need? Lyn what do we need to switch?	B-OO
L: We need to have new programing up here.	I-OO
F: Alright, can you help me with that because I don’t really, I'm not really clear on what you’re saying.	I-OO
S: We’re meant to drive it right into the back wall and then we’ll get nine points.	B-A
F: Yeah, cool.	B-OO
L: Okay. Plug it in.	I-OO
F: So we’ll get twenty one points I guess, I don’t think it really matters, but, since it's not a real competition or anything.	I-OO
L: Okay what are these? Which ones are these?	B-ATO
F: Um I don’t know.	B-OO
L: What did you last switch?	B-ATV
F: This was the last one I switched.  I don’t know what all those are for?	I-ATV
S: (Fiona)/(Let me see)	B-OO
F: That’s the turn.	B-ATO
L: Yeah so (?).	B-OO
S: Very close to done?	I-OO
L: I don’t know.	I-OO
F: We can’t tell until we test it.	I-OO
L: You guys can go ahead.	I-OO
LBS: Thank you.	O
S: Sam I'm gonna go bathroom quickly okay?	B-OO
T: Oh don’t forget to take off your...	O
S: I’m just gonna (?)	B-OO
T: You were gonna (?)	O
F: So Sam, sorry we just need our thing to end up on that side right?	B-A
T: If you touch the wall...	O
L: (?) is in the bathroom	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
T: (?)	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Are you guys going again?	I-OO
F: Ah okay.	I-OO
L: Yeah.  Do you know where it gets lined up?	B-A
F: What?	B-OO
L: Do you know where it gets lined up?	B-A
F: No.	B-OO
L: Okay (so I need you to stand up there) (?).	I-OO
F: Is it like that?	B-A
L: No it goes okay.	I-A
F: Oh...	B-OO
L: Okay can...	I-OO
M: One more try and then let’s have another team come in.	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay, yeah sorry.	I-OO
LBS: That’s okay.	O
L: Oh...	B-OO
F: OK	I-OO
F: I don't think we have any more time to work on it.	I-OO
F: I guess it won't do anything.	I-OO
F: I think we are suppose to stop now.	I-OO
L:  It's not going to work.	B-NSTO
F:  We don't even know if the last things are going to bring it to the back wall.	B-A
F: Yeah	B-OO
F: Mostly	I-OO
L: It gets stuck back there.	B-DO
L: I know it would go to the back.	B-A
F:  Yes, this is that think where it goes there so why is all this here.	B-ATO
F: We don't need...	B-DO
L: No, that's for the back.	B-ATO
L: That's how it gets to the back.	I-ATO
F: OK	B-OO
L:  I'm going to delete this one though.  Nope, not that.	B-ATO
L:  How do I?	B-QS
L: OK, let's see if that helps.	B-OO
F:  No, but that's just two driving things.	B-ATO
L:  Yeah, I know.	B-OO
F:  No, it's going to go five point five	B-ATV
L:  OK, yeah, let's ?	B-OO
L:  I don’t know if this is going to do anything.	B-QS
L:  We haven't taken a last turn	B-OO
S:  OK, did we fix it?	I-OO
F:  We don't know	I-OO
S: Yup	I-OO
F: I think we just need to make that a tiny bit longer.	B-ATV
L: On the backing up one?	B-ATO
L:  How do I back up again?	I-ATO
F: You just do the regular thing, but just make it negative.	B-ATV
F: Oh, they are doing the hand raising.	B-OO

S: Huh?	B-OO
L: Are you okay?	I-OO
F: (?) how those things are? That sensor.	B-A
L: Okay. It happens (?) down there.	B-QS
L: Okay I'm just gonna move it, all down.	I-QS
Y: How’s it going?	O
F: Good.	B-OO
T: Effortless. On my part	O
Y: Well they’re doing all the work.	O
T: They are.	O
F: It should be effortless.	B-OO
S: Sarah.	I-OO
Y: Sarah, and you guys where you live?	O
L: Vermont.	B-OO
Y: Where in Vermont?	O
F: Oh they live in Marlborough and I live in Guilford.	B-OO
Y: Are you all at the same school?	O
F: Um We were at the same school for a while, I lived in, I used to live in Marlborough but I go to the school called (?) School which is in (?).	B-OO
S: She ran away from our weirdness.	I-OO
F: Yeah I ran away from them.	I-OO
S: And our terrible PE teacher.	I-OO
Y: So are you a teacher (?)?	O
T: I am a teacher I'm also (?).	B-OO
Y: Are you at their school?	O
T: I am at their school.	O
Y: Yes.	O
T: I used to teach her.	O
Y: How did you find out about?	O
T: A friend of ours is in the (?) Technology and program at Marlborough (?) school do you know that program and somehow she was sent information about it	O
L: Okay, I'm gonna save this.	B-QS
Y: What’s her name?	O
T: Rebecca Briscoe	O
Y: (?).	O
L: I'm gonna save it okay.	B-QS
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: Sarah are you ready?	I-OO
F: Sarah.	I-OO
S: Yeah coming.	I-OO
F: Okay. Alright lets do it. Banbury Two.	I-OO
L: Okay, you guys ready?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Hmm, hmm.	I-OO
F: Oh it got knocked off by a fish, yeah.	B-DO
S: Okay so little less because,	I-DO
L: okay what happens if we start from somewhere else then?	B-A
S: Yeah it’s gotta start right at the edge.	I-A
L: Right at the edge, so we’ll go for.	I-A
F: Yeah that’s not gonna work.	B-NSTO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: How hard is that (?)?	B-A
F: It's running over the fish.	B-DO
S: Oh okay.	B-OO
F: So do we need to make it turn more or not hit the fish?	B-DO
L: Hold on.	B-OO
F: No but that’s, returns are gonna be messed up.	B-DO
L: Oh yeah. Yay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Also I think that we wanted to hit the...	B-A
F: That.	B-OO
L: Alright	I-OO
M: Are you Banbury Cheeses?	O
L: Yes.	B-OO
M: You’re gonna be the next team to come out for judging.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
M: So you’re gonna break, not quite yet, I gotta bring the other team back in but you’re gonna turn off your microphones and you’re gonna bring your robot and any attachments that you have.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: I think we’re going to have to make it go not so far.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: I think it was okay before we don’t need to (?).	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: I mean I, I don’t think it's even that important.	I-OO
S: Don’t put it down to what it was before because otherwise it wont go far enough, but your...	B-A
F: I don’t think the most important part is like, oh sorry, is...like getting as many points it's just like getting the hang of the programing thing. (?)	B-OO
L: Two point five?	B-ATV
F: Yeah, that’s what it was before right? Or it was two	I-ATV
L: I think it was two. I shall save. Okay	I-ATV
F: Yeah	B-OO
L: Lets test it.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Okay, its hitting the truck. That’s actually, lets try it again.	B-DO
L: And it's also hitting over here.	I-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: I don’t know why that’s there.	I-OO
F: It only did that because it hit the truck I think, lets just try it again and see what’s happening.	B-DO
L: It's off the base.	B-A
F: Right.	B-OO
M: Bring your robot	O
<Microphones turned off whilst with judges>	O
09:20 S: Okay, so	O
F: we need to change distances.	B-ATV
L: Yes.	B-OO
S: (Where’s my map is this my map?) Okay.	I-OO
F: I think we already changed some, yeah we already try it out (?).	I-OO
S: Okay. Okay so knock this right here there’s no reason to freak out lets (it’s safe it’s sound an-)	I-OO
T: The map is still there.	O
S: Yes the most important thing ever, (is that) the robot.	B-OO
F: Okay. Alright we need it to not...	B-DO
S: Easy turn to the left.	B-ATO
F: ...we can use wow.	B-NSTO
S: What’s it doing? What’s it doing?	I-NSTO
10:00 F: It's getting skewed by stuff, erm maybe we could put,   maybe we could try some stuff with sensors so that when	B-DO
it feels stuff	O
L: I don’t know maybe we should...	B-A
S: I don’t think we should cos it will take too long.	I-A
L: Yeah let’s just keep (?).	B-OO
F: Alright let’s see er, maybe we can make it turn a little bit later but not too late.	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Let’s see it again, I wanna see what it does.	I-OO
L: Let’s get the turn a little bit shorter cause it could,	B-ATO
S: I want a small, I think you should make a smaller turn because it's tipping towards it slightly.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Smaller turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And the shorter turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Shorter distance, okay. Okay.	B-ATO
S: Where did my chair go? I think they took my chair.	B-OO
L: Yeah Mama please can Sarah have your chair?	I-OO
F: Oh I think that that table has one	I-OO
S: No I think she took my chair, I think one of you took my chair. They’re not listening.	I-OO
T: Get that one over there there’s one (?).	O
L: Alright okay	B-OO
S: Can I take this chair. We’re one short on our table.	I-OO
F: So which turn was that that was messing it up? (The first turn?)	B-ATO
L: The first turn.	I-ATO
F: Alright lets make it...	B-ATV
L: So... One.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Maybe.	I-OO
L: Okay and then a distant and then it has to go short distance so...	B-ATO
F: One point	B-ATV
L: Two five?	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Whoops.	I-OO
F: Wait, was it the first distance it was throwing it off or the second distance?	B-ATO
S: The second.	I-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Well yeah.	I-OO
S: I think it was the turning in the distance because it was slightly too far and... (?)	B-ATO
F: Alright lets try it with this.	B-OO
L: Yeah, okay wait, okay.	I-OO
S: Which table could we go to? Sorry. Maybe you should carry the map for a special bonus.	I-OO
L: Maybe it has the (?).	I-OO
F: (?) I think this thing is the sensor thing, could be (?) on with that.	B-A
S: Yeah  it’s like (?) (clothes dispenser) it’s like a tissue dispenser, make it bigger and it could be like a tissue driver  it drives tissues up the staircase for you.	I-A
F: You guys wanna try...	B-OO
L: Do we really need it?	I-OO
S: Just leave the map	I-OO
F: I don’t know, it think it would be cool but, whatever.	B-A
She’s not giving us the answers she’s just...	O
T: Just thought it would be cool.	B-OO
S: We don’t have time to hook up sensors.	B-A
F: No we have time.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: (?).	I-OO
L: Okay it needs to go further and not (?).	B-DO
S: Okay further this way and more that way after that.	I-DO
L: I think see that it goes like this and then it kind of turns that way more.	I-DO
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: So the turn needs to be more straight and then it needs to go forward.	B-ATO
F: Lets try it again and see,	B-OO
L: Do you want to watch it (?).	I-OO
L: One of the right angles (?).	B-ATO
F: Sure yeah	B-OO
L: Alright can we get a pen Sarah? So we can write on the other side of your tissue (?).	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: (?) a pen.	I-OO
S: Hold the tissue map (?).	I-OO
F: I don’t	I-OO
L: Why?	I-OO
L: (?) two hands?	I-OO
F: huh huh huh	I-OO
S: No, I lost one in a war, it was a war for a brownie it was epic.	I-OO
L: Oh okay	I-OO
F: Who were you fighting?	I-OO
S: I don’t know actually.	I-OO
L: Are you going to write?	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: I think (?) The whipped cream is flying everywhere.	I-OO
F: Okay, alright.	I-OO
L: Yeah that has to turn...	B-DO
F: So it's the second turn.	I-DO
L: ...and that needs to go.	I-DO
F: Alright so the second turn is what we need to change.	I-DO
S: No fair their’s got eye balls.	B-OO
L: Okay, second turn and I think a little bit of a shorter (?).	B-ATO
S: Are these sensors	B-A
F: On?	B-OO
L: On after the second turn	B-ATO
F: Okay	B-OO
S: Are these sensors?	B-A
L: Yeah I don’t think so. Okay.	B-OO
F: I can sense that on my face Sarah	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
<laughs>	O
L: Second turn...is there like a second turn?	B-ATO
F: Um	B-OO
L: Wait it goes (?).	B-ATO
F: Yeah that’s the second turn.	I-ATO
L: So shorter second turn.	I-ATO
F: I don’t know.	B-OO
L: So one...	B-ATV
S: Can plug things into these ones, this is I think is some sort of (?) sensor.	B-A
F: Should be one, one.	B-ATV
S: Camera pluggy thing.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: I'm gonna video tape something now.	I-OO
L: Okay, now we’re just doing like (?).	B-A
F: Yeah. But that’s cool it works better that way probably. Because then we’re not estimating.	I-A
S2: Go ahead	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: I just hope it works this way.	I-OO
F: Wait, lets line it up with the sides so we actually know where it is.	B-A
L: Here?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah still needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Oh we need it to go further.	I-DO
S: Farther that way	I-DO
L: Farther farther yeah	I-DO
F: Before it makes that third turn.	B-ATO
L: No this, yeah...	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: No but the fish... We run over the fish.	B-A
L: Well we were trying but then the fish (?)	I-A
T: What if you put something long on the end?	O
F: But the fish...	B-A
L: The fish.	B-OO
F: The fish. The fish	B-A
T: It could stick.	O
H: (?) right?	B-OO
F: What?	I-OO
H: As long as you don’t move the baby fish it doesn’t matter.	O
T: Yeah you can move the fish.	O
S: No it isn’t the moving the fish that’s the matter it's the hitting the fish itself.	B-A
H: (?)	O
F: It runs over the fish and  kinda s’cuse it yeah.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Alright so we need to make the thing after the second turn or the third turn?	B-ATO
L: Second turn.	I-ATO
T: (?) if you just stick a little stick on there (?).	O
L: Oh wait that was...	B-OO
T: It might be an extra two points that’s all.	O
L: I'm sorry (?) don’t want walking all the way over there.	B-OO
F: I think it would be cool to just try to get this done first and then if we have some extra time to do it, yeah.	I-OO
T: It's candy.	O
F: It’s candy	B-OO
L: Okay, lets say two?	B-ATV
F: Two yeah.	I-ATV
T: Bonus for (?).	O
F: ha ha ha (?) check, destroy everything.	B-OO
S: Okay, evil genius list I’ll start writing.	I-OO
L: Lets hope this works now.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay Sarah you can keep on writing. Fiona and I shall...	I-OO
S: I'm writing an evil genius (?) completely doing nothing.	I-OO
L: Okay if that’s what you wanna do I guess. (?) to go.	I-OO
S: It's slightly off but I don’t think (not enough to) matter.	B-DO
F: Ah	B-OO
L: Okay that needs to be...	B-DO
F: It needs to go a little further.	I-DO
S: Tiny bit, you’re almost there.	I-DO
F: Oh okay.	B-OO
S: We’re almost there anyway, almost.	B-DO
L: A little bit farther.	I-DO
F: I wanna just (?).	B-OO
S: Look, Lyn look evil genius list.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Waha	I-OO
L: What’s shorter than one point two five? Besides one.	B-ATV
F: Wait I think we need to make it longer. Oh, oh the turn? Er one point one.	I-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: And we need to make one of the turns a little bit...	B-ATO
L: Yeah I did that.	B-OO
F: One of the distances. Okay (?).	B-ATV
<General classroom noise>	O
L: Okay back. (I always forget) (?)go immediately.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: That distance just needs to be a little longer. Yeah we got it there.	B-DO
L: This one a little longer and then we add the (?). Because it goes waaa.	I-DO
T: It's gonna be a little bit of a tricky turn.	O
L: Yeah, well...	B-OO
F: We can have it go diagonal and then diagonal and then straighten itself out, but I (?).	B-A
L: Okay so the last turn is a little longer right?	B-ATO
F: Yeah should be like two.	B-ATV
L: So two point five?...wait I mean not two point five, two, one, one point...	I-ATV
F: Wait, was it the turn or the distance, oh that’s the, oh that’s moving it.	B-ATO
L: Distance was good the turn I think was a little short because...	I-ATO
F: No I think it, the distance should be longer when it goes.	I-ATO
L: Yeah, yeah that’s right, sorry (?) so one point five do you think?	B-ATV
F: Um lets make it two,	I-ATV
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Lets make it two.	B-ATV
L: Okay. Right, now...	B-OO
F: And then maybe we can scale it down to one point seven five, I don’t know how to connect them, maybe, (?) we could ask someone how we connect the things together.	B-ATV
L: Okay, maybe mom will know, shall we ask?	B-OO
F: Lets just try doing it and see if it strings them together.	B-QS
L: Okay, so...	B-OO
F: It would be a turn.	B-ATO
L: ...okay which way?	I-ATO
F: Um it goes that way it’ll need to be turning to the right so that would B or C? that would be C.	B-ATV
L: (?) add another play, maybe that will help, so B you said?	B-QS
F: C? wait, which one turns it to the right?	B-ATV
20:00 L: Um	B-OO
F: It's, okay I wanna see which one...	I-OO
L: I think it's B.	B-ATV
F: Because B is connected to this one which is on, I think it's C ac-, wait, that one’s C and that one turns to the left, so it's B I think yeah, sorry.	I-ATV
L: Okay it's B and then we go forward, like two?	I-ATV
S: Look at my evil (?)	B-OO
F: Yeah lets make it go two, Sarah do you want something to do?	B-ATV
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: Okay why don’t you help answer the questions (?) okay? Lets see if that works.	I-OO
S: Look at my evil list.	I-OO
<laughs>	O
L: Your (older sister) is three (?).	B-OO
F: (?) brownie mix.	I-OO
S: Hee hee hee hee	I-OO
L: Oh my god. Okay.	I-OO
F: You downloaded alright?	B-QS
S: See this is what boredom does to one.	B-OO
F: Why are you bored Sarah? You should be (?)	I-OO
S: Because you guys are (programing I’ve got nothing to do)	I-OO
L: You can help answering the question.	I-OO
F: Why is it going forward?	B-DO
L: What?	B-NSTO
S: Why didn’t it turn?	B-DO
L: Oh okay so I guess its connecting doesn’t work like that, we need help really.	I-DO
F: Yeah lets, lets just ask somebody.	B-OO
S: Don’t know how to connect what?	B-QS
F: Lets show you what we’re talking about Sarah. Er	B-OO
L: Alright. Sarah?	I-OO
S: I'm fixing the fish, don’t judge me.	I-OO
F: Okay so look at the computer in your swivel chair of evil, so we need to be able to connect that to that, oh maybe we...	B-QS
T: Can you just slide it over it?	O
L: No I already did that.	B-QS
F: It doesn’t, maybe if we, if we get rid of the...	I-QS
L: It doesn’t.	I-QS
F: Yeah I know...	B-OO
L: Cos then (?).	I-OO
F: ...but what if we click this, wait? And like connect it...	B-QS
L: Oh yeah.	B-OO
T: Oooh, who’s a smarty pants?	O
F: Yeah alright.	B-OO
T: Yeah.	O
L: There we go, save...there we go, okay. Okay work.	B-QS
F: Oh...	B-OO
L: Oh okay.	I-OO
S: We could remove that bit	B-DO
F: We can make it turn earlier, we can just make it a shorter distance and have it turn earlier.	I-DO
S: Or we can just remove that bit	I-DO
L: Okay and have it plough over the pizza.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Who cares about the pizza? we’ve got the...	B-A
F: I don’t think we, or it doesn’t even have to be that much earlier.	B-DO
T: (?)	B-OO
S: I don’t want no pizza.	I-OO
F: Huh huh. No pizza.	I-OO
S: At least not that pizza that pizza looks yucky ...no you dropped the brownie mix.	I-OO
F: Huh huh. Okay, sorry.	I-OO
S: huh huh	I-OO
L: Okay. So, shorter distance before the turn.	B-ATO
F: Yeah before the final turn. So it would be this one I think. Oh it's not okay, oh you, you need to be selected on that I think.	I-ATO
L: No it's, it's this one, cos...	I-ATO
F: Oh not, er yeah it is.	B-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: Okay. You guys wanna take it? Sarah	I-OO
F: Yes. Sarah do you wanna test it?	I-OO
S: Okay. Where’d they get the treads	I-OO
S: We know how to turn it right?	O
L: The what?	B-OO
S: The treads where’d they get them?	I-OO
T: That piece?	O
S: Yes.	B-OO
T: (?).	O
L: Oh,	B-OO
S: (?) turn the	I-OO
T: axle forwards and (axle) backwards and then turn.	O
L: Alright	B-OO
F: Ready?	I-OO
S: So right here?	B-A
F: It was more like there.	I-A
L: Sarah why don’t you do the rest of the programming?	B-OO
F: Alright, yeah, Banbury Cheese.	I-OO
L: Banbury two	I-OO
F: Banbury two.	I-OO
L: Yes.	I-OO

L: What? I’m sorry guys.	B-OO
T: If you’re like...you know how you’re kinda coming at it at an angle.	O
F: Yeah, maybe there’s a way to go around and come back.	B-A
T: Or or could you just, when you come (?) the thing. You know you’re, you’re coming this way right...	O
F: Huh, huh.	B-OO
T: ...could you just put like one extra turn in here (?) your turn and go straight.	O
F: Probably, I don’t know	B-A
T: It feels like there’s (?)	O
F: I feel like yeah we only have like thirty minutes left to do stuff so.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think if we  stay focused (?) you.	I-OO
L: Okay, so lets see it goes straight, it, so it goes wah  wah wah	B-DO
S: <humming>	B-OO
L: Okay Fiona.	I-OO
T: Are you best do it on the floor with just...	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah. Hey Sarah do you want to help?	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay why don’t you help Fiona with the, like creating the area.	I-OO
S: Which area?	I-OO
L: On the floor.	I-OO
S: Are we finishing our second one?	I-OO
L: No, first one, perfecting it.	I-OO
F: Yeah because we don’t, the first one’s inconsistent it's probably gonna make us feel worse about the second one then it might not do so well.	B-DO
S: But the second one never mind	B-OO
L: Can you guys make the area?	I-OO
F: What do you mean like make a...	I-OO
L: Like. Sort of set up like that (?) the program.	I-OO
F: Alright. The thing that’s like (?) the napkin, it’s like there and then it. I’ll make a thing that. alright.	I-OO
L: Okay, ready? Lets go play.	I-OO
F: I don’t know, wait...	I-OO
L: What?	I-OO
S: Okay that didn’t work.	B-NSTO
F: Sorry I need to er	B-OO
S: Ah...	I-OO
L: Okay lets, what’s going for...	I-OO
L: Straight. Okay I need to try that again, can you straighten it up?  This is our original one okay.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
T: I don’t understand what’s happened	O
L: What?	B-OO
T: (?) the turn. Is this number one?	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
T: So (?) back to base now?	O
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
T: (?) not back where he started.	O
F: I know it doesn’t	B-A
S: It's a large okay.	I-A
F: ...it doesn’t need to be...	I-A
T: (?) base.	O
F: ...the base is er the whole like square thing.	B-A
S: Yeah if we start from here it goes like this and then...	I-A
F: Did we make any changes?	B-OO
S: ...yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah one, I just want to see what it actually does on the real...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
F: It's kind of difficult to tell with this one.	I-OO
S: Remember it starts from the back.	B-A
L: Yeah. Like so?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I don’t know what this (?)? Okay it needs to turn more on that section.	B-DO
F: Oh.	B-NSTO
S: It worked again.	I-NSTO
F: It randomly does it though because it hits this and that fabric is a little lumpy we shouldn’t rely on this.	B-A
L: Okay. I’m going to switch it can you clean that up?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Thank you.	I-OO
S: Okay I wanna see a bulldozer at work.	I-OO
S: We should make it turn the other way.	B-ATO
L: It just if it gets back to base you can change it.	B-A
F: I feel like we should redo it so it goes like this, this, this, this and this so we can have it start...	I-A
L: Wait, just let me. I just need to switch to (?).	B-OO
F: No.	I-OO
L: Okay	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Make it lower down a little.	B-A
F: I feel like, Lyn do you think that we could just kind of, it's not really starting from scratch but if we make it go instead of doing all that stuff, if it goes right angle, right angle, er right angle right angle and knocks this over and then it goes back, back and back.	I-A
L: Okay, yeah.	B-OO
F: I just feel like it would be easier to do that.	B-A
T: If you, you know how you guys get all the way over here?	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
T: If you get, touch the wall you get a lot of points.	O
F: If you touch the wall?	B-A
T: Yeah if you actually end up touching the wall that’s a distance travel.	O
F: Oh cool.	B-OO
T: So that wall’s worth nine points if you end up here.	O
F: Oh, okay.	B-OO
S: Think we should get there?	I-OO
F: Maybe we should just try for the second one?	I-OO
T: Yeah.	O
F: The one, those two and touching the back.	B-A
T: Yeah.	O
F: Lyn, we’re thinking maybe we could just try for the second one instead of trying to figure out this one, seem it's kind of tough, that we could just focus on doing the second one since we get points for touching the back wall anyway.	B-A
L: We do?	B-OO
F: Yeah I think so, we get nine points if we touch the back wall.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: So where are we with that? I think we have...lets test it with the second one?	I-OO
L: Yeah, okay you guys want to go and try it?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Okay, where was it for the second one?	B-A
S: Umm...	B-OO
F: Here.	B-A
F: Okay, okay so it was like...alright.	I-A
F: Why is it...what...okay that, that, it was, that’s weird it didn’t go as far as it normally does.	B-NSTO
S: Okay. Okay so we want it to go further this way.	B-A
L: Okay so when it goes there it should be long, lets do it so it goes that way.	I-A
F: Alright Sarah lets do it again so that we can actually like, I, I just want to be able to see what’s going on too. Lyn was this the front of the, did this count in front of that...	B-OO
L: I didn’t make that one but I think so, I think Sarah made it.	I-OO
S: Wait, what do you want me to explain?	I-OO
F: So was this front line, was that this or the tyre? Did that represent the front or this thing	B-A
S: I think, I forget.	B-OO
LGS: Well on the test I last saw it, this was here.	O
F: Yeah well that was for another setting we had for it, but thanks.	B-A
L: Lets try it from there.	I-A
F: I think it was supposed to be, this one was supposed to be two back.	I-A
L: Yeah except it was over	I-A
F: And over	I-A
L: Three.	I-A
F: Three okay.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
LGS: Well what are you fixing?	O
L: No three over three so one, two, three like here.	B-A
F: There?	I-A
L: No the tire.	I-A
F: The tire? Oh okay.	I-A
L: Try that, I think that might (affect what we have).	I-A
F: Yeah I think we just need to make that distance longer. What? Okay.	B-ATV
L: Well...	B-NSTO
F: No.	B-OO
S: It's crashing.	B-NSTO
F: Alright lets fix that.	B-OO
L: Okay what do we need to switch?	B-ATO
S: Okay we need to make things that when it goes that way it's longer.	B-ATV
F: Yeah we need one of the distances to be longer.	I-ATV
S: Haba	B-OO
F: Sarah.	I-OO
L: Sarah.	I-OO
S: Sorry.	I-OO
F: Come on.	I-OO
S: Okay so what are we doing?	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
L: So it goes forward, turns, forward, turns when, when does it go wrong?	B-ATO
F: I think it was that one. Wait, does this have a touch (screen)	I-ATO
L: Turn.	I-ATO
F: ...what it's a touch screen, what.	B-OO
T: Ha ha ha ha	O
L: What?	B-OO
F: What kind of future, but it has a keyboard.	I-OO
S: What is it?	I-OO
F: It's just one of the new windows computers that okay, this is more tedious.	I-OO
L: Yeah so it goes forward and then turn whoa, whoa and then it goes forward again, turns.	B-ATO
T: What happened to your map? You have a map of two?	O
L: Okay and again make it...	B-ATV
S: Yeah, two maps.	B-OO
L: ...one point (?).	B-ATV
T: (?) looking at.	O
S: Well they have so.	B-OO
F: Did you change the distance of that of one of the (?).	B-ATV
L: (?) they go like this, like this, they go like this...;	B-ATO
F: Alright lets just try it now, that’s fine.	B-OO
S: ...(?).	I-OO
F: I’ll stay here and I can make changes.	I-OO
S: But (?) variation it can go like this, touch the back wall (?) go right there and go back and forward.	B-ATO
L: (?) that was incorrect.	B-NSTO
F: That one needs to be longer.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I think so. Okay. Okay.	B-OO
F: It will be sad if (?) the people who have the cheering sound fail the challenge they’ll be wo::::h huh huh huh  huh	I-OO
T: Be like upside down.	O
<laughs>	O
F: You tried.	B-OO
S: (?) What?	I-OO
T: (?) robot makes the cheering sound, you like that (?) upside down (?).	O
L: Oh my gosh. Okay um, this second, okay so...	B-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
L: No way. This has to be shorter.	B-ATV
F: This one?	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: The turn, oh no...	B-ATO
L: Oh no the distance...	B-ATV
F: One, is that one point two five now, how much shorter does it need to be?	I-ATV
L: How about one Sarah?	I-ATV
F: Alright, well I need to download it to that before, before it works, as long as it's wireless, why can’t these future computers be wireless.	B-QR
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Okay I think it downloaded, wait.	B-QR
L: Got it?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: (?) Internet Explorer, whatever that is.	I-OO
L: Fiona I think that you switched the wrong one.	B-ATV
F: Oh which one was it? Okay, which one did I switch? I switched...	I-ATV
L: That needs to be longer.	I-ATV
L: Okay and this one should be shorter.	I-ATV
F: So this one should be one point two five again?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: This one?	B-ATO
L: No it should be should be shorter so like two. I don’t know if we’re actually going to get it to work like, have something that works by the end.	B-ATV
F: We’re ahead of some of the other teams, in terms of how well it works.	B-OO
S: I wanna get this kit.	I-OO
F: Yeah it's gonna be so cool to do it. Yeah, the only one who have to work with other people.	I-OO
S: You could use your (own) table for the air hockey.	I-OO
T: (?) coke on it.	O
S: Well at least you got some points.	B-OO
L: Okay Sarah can you come here?	I-OO
S: What are we doing?	I-OO
L: Okay so when it goes... Can you just tell me, count for me how many turns this is. Okay so.	B-ATO
S: Okay.	B-OO
L: It goes...	I-OO
S: One, two, three...	B-A
L: No that’s two right.	I-A
F: One turn, two turns...	I-A
S: Three turns, four turns.	I-A
L: Okay on this, Fiona after the third turn it has to go forward... the	B-ATO
F: Go forward (?) more.	B-ATV
L: Yeah like two.	I-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Alright do you wanna plug it in? Here you go, turn it around so it can	I-OO
F: Hmm, hmm. What you eating?	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
F: Oh I thought you were eating something, (?).	I-OO
S: You'd like me to eat something, no I'm not eating anything, why did you think I was eating? Fiona.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Princess time, tall...	I-OO
T: (?)	O
S: I watch, I don’t usually get to watch Netflix, but yeah I watch Sci-Fi and stuff like that.	B-OO
T: Have you ever watched Star Trek?	O
S: I don’t think so, but I have seen Farscape.	B-OO
L: Are you sending it back to the same place?	B-A
T: How was that?	O
S: I was liking it, I didn’t get all the way through it though.	B-OO
L: Needs to be a bit longer.	B-ATV
F: Yes Sarah know where, okay Sarah.	B-OO
S: Okay good.	I-OO
F: Did you catch (?) one that I changed to two last time, so, this one right. No. Control Z does that work okay.	B-ATV
L: Oh thank god that was (frightening).	B-OO
F: Alright, two and a half?	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: I think it's that one.	B-ATO
S: Okay to run it?	B-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
S: Just a tiny bit more.	B-ATV
F: A little further.	I-ATV
S: Yeah tiny bit more like maybe two point six or something.	I-ATV
F: Yeah that’s what I was...	B-OO
S: Or two point five, five.	B-ATV
F: Alright.	B-OO
F: Tiny bit more?	B-ATV
S: Ah.	B-NSTO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Two point seven?	B-ATV
L: Huh?	B-P
F: Two point seven.	B-ATV
L: You said that it doesn’t have to get back to base?	B-A
T: No in fact if you get it partly (?).	O
L: Oh okay.	B-OO
T: If you had time you could go for the second (fish).	O
L: Ah	B-OO
F: Sarah pick it up.	I-OO
S: Ow	B-NSTO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: I'm, I'm in the middle of mourning (the) loss.	I-OO
L: I'm gonna try this again though.	I-OO
S: I think we need to find a way to tuck those wires in, de we still have rubber bands kicking around?	B-D
F: What happens if you hit a fish?	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: What do the fishes do?	B-A
T: Nothing, they’re just (?).	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
T: But it’s not like they take points off or anything	O
S: Come on, come on, come on, live, do it for us, yes, noooo.	B-NSTO
L: Alright.	I-NSTO
S: We were closer last time. They got a claw now?	I-NSTO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Sweet.	I-OO
<General classroom noise>	O
S: It ain’t got enough bacteria down, come on fly free.	B-OO
L: No, okay (?).	B-NSTO
S: Just make sure you line it up right and then we’re good.	B-A
L: Nope	B-NSTO

L: Okay. Well...	B-OO
F: You can use it.	I-OO
S: Why is it running over the lever?	B-DO
F: That was so weird it worked the first time and then it didn’t work at all after that.	I-DO
S: Yeah the lever had a little...	B-A
T: Do you think you need a little plough kinda thing?	O
L: Well we’re making one but that’s not going to affect it.	B-D
F: That’s not the problem it's not about...	B-DO
S: Okay I have an idea for the plough.	B-D
F: ...it's about not being able to run over it, it's just running over the lever instead of actually pushing it.	B-DO
S: We want something for the back or the front?	B-D
L: The back.	I-D
F: The back.	I-D
L: Back.	I-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay lets figure out how to back this thing up now.	B-ATO
S: Okay if we’re gonna have something to the back then we’re gonna (?).	B-D
F: Okay	B-OO
L: I don’t see where the connection to the back, lets just make it to the front.	B-D
L: Okay. Fiona let’s figure how to back this up	B-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: You got a plan Sarah you said?	B-A
S: For a plough?	B-D
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I’m trying to figure it out now but (?). Put it down.	B-D
S: Hold on we’re, Fiona’s setting something up right now Sarah and it's not going to help if you keep on smacking the table because I'm not going to listen to you people again.	B-OO
S: Lyn don’t mess with me I have plastic.	I-OO
L: Sarah don’t mess with me I'm sick and I'm getting grouchy, I will lick you.	I-OO
S: You realize you have my sickness right?	I-OO
L: Yes I know.	I-OO
S: And I’ve given it to you so it wouldn’t really matter if you lick my face or not.	I-OO
F: Okay, yeah.	I-OO
S: All you’ll really be doing is taking from the (?)orginal source.	I-OO
F: Move your foot	I-OO
S: My foot was there first.	I-OO
F: So it should move back two probably or three.	B-ATV
S: Okay, let me check out whether this plough thing’s gonna work.	B-D
F: Alright I'm gonna, do you want to move it back to start?	B-A
L: Yeah, okay.	B-OO
S: Well lets see this plough. Oh (?).	B-D
L: Okay and then turn, that’s okay so you have...	B-DO
S: I say stick these two here.	B-D
L: This is the right side has to turn.	B-ATO
F: Alright so that one is B or C? I think it's B.	B-ATV
L: No I think it might C.	I-ATV
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Okay, go ahead and try it now, Sarah (your lights) might want to look out.	I-OO
S: (I don’t stretch this far).	I-OO
L: Yeah there we go.	B-NSTO
S: Okay let me test this.	B-OO
F: I thought we might want to do it (?)	B-A
L: Okay. And then...	B-OO
F: This needs to be like one...	B-ATV
S: Let me test, let me test (?) t t t t t t.	B-OO
L: Okay (?) Fiona	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Sarah I have to set it out.	I-OO
S: No.	I-OO
L: Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah. No.	I-OO
S: I'm trying to make you a plough here it's what you wanted me to do isn’t it?	B-D
F: Okay lets, lets make the plough.	I-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Okay should we use these like little (?) things?	B-D
L: What?	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: What do you mean (?)? No it should be in the um back.	B-D
S: We (can’t) attach to back.	I-D
L: Well it needs...	I-D
S: There’s no easy way to attach it.	I-D
L: ...because, well it only works in the back is the thing.	I-D
S: We could get it to turn a whole circle though?	B-A
L: No we don’t have enough room.	I-A
S: Okay, so lets, you know pull this one out.  We want, if we’re gonna do actually...oh, what is this right here?	B-D
L: It's um.	B-OO
F: Guys we could start it backwards and then make it go forwards,	B-ATO
L: That would be	B-OO
F: We could reverse everything and make all of it negative.	B-ATV
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: So we just start it backwards.	B-A
L: Okay lets do it that way.	B-OO
F: Negative fifty, no, no one fifty negative fifty	B-ATV
S: Why is my foot warm?	B-OO
F: ...negative.	B-ATV
L: I don’t know Sarah did your foot pee?	B-OO
S: No I don’t think so, but feel it.	I-OO
L: Probably because you were just sitting on it.	I-OO
S: Sure. Be a critic.	I-OO
L: What? What you asked for an answer, I think that’s the most logical thing is (?).	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
S: They have the bionic, bionical bulldogs and we’ve got cheese.	I-OO
F: We decided (?)	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: ...so that we start it in reverse so we can go forward and have the plough be going forward.	B-ATO
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Hopefully it works, so we’re gonna start it backwards.	B-ATO
L: Yeah okay, Sarah do you mind moving your...	B-OO
F: Sarah your (?).	I-OO
L: Okay. What?	I-OO
F: We can just reverse the, this just needs to be B, that one...	B-ATV
L: They both need to be B.	I-ATV
S: Wait pass me my pen.	B-OO
F: Okay (?).	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Okay, Lyn, Fiona look at this design for the plough.	B-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: So we used some of these rocks here as like the things that scrape on the ground and they’re connected to the bars, wait pull up this thing and you’re connected to these things right here somehow.	B-D
L: Do these (?)?	B-OO
F: No they don’t have.	B-D
S: They have to be connected with something.	I-D
L: But they don’t connect is the problem.	I-D
S: Not, no, no, no not there, in here, put it down like on the table.	I-D
L: Oh we could use these red ones.	I-D
S: That’s why I pulled them out.	I-D
L: Yeah or (?).	B-OO
S: Might (?) light blue ones.	B-D
L: No, no it’s good, okay.	B-OO
S: And then we string a bar between the two of them.	B-D
L: Okay here good, a red one, do we need, oh yeah we should have a bar. (?) Do you want this? No never.	I-D
S: Wait, wait we could have, hmm, we could have it like that.	I-D
L: Yeah maybe that would work okay, wait so...like...	I-D
S: No, no, no, no like a (?).	B-OO
L: Yeah I'm going to connect it and then you...	B-D
S: No, no we cant, no we cant.	B-OO
L: ...no I'm going to connect it then you (?).	B-D
S: No you’re putting it on backwards, oh wait actually that would work better.	I-D
L: Well you can always twist it that’s the thing.	I-D
S: Yeah but you guys want to put them on the same because that one’s backwards compared to the other one...See what I mean, they’re backwards.	I-D
L: Hmm. Lets see. (?)...okay.	B-OO
F: I'm gonna bring a chair over because I'm too lazy to stand.	I-OO
S: We want to use one of these really long ones and we want to put them in one of the lower ones.	B-D
F: It's kind of annoying that we don’t have actual lego bricks...	I-D
S: Yeah.	B-OO
F: ...because that would (build it) really easy.	B-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah that one needs to be...	B-D
L: Okay, like this Sarah?	I-D
S: Lets see, I had it like, I'm sure I had it like, dip, dip, dip, dip...	I-D
F: But I thought you were making it the same way?	I-D
S: (?) this.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Here. Okay.	I-OO
T: (?)you guys are adding sensors?	O
F: We’re making a plough.	B-D
T: Oh good.	O
S: And there we go.	B-D
L: Oh sorry.	B-OO
S: I think we’re blocking the camera.	I-OO
F: Oh. I can move.	I-OO
R: You don’t have to worry about that.	O
S: No not you. I think all of us are. And then bar in-between and then (?), and then it doesn’t need to be that high, too high off the ground. Is it falling off real easily?	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Sarah I don’t think this (make) is gonna work.	B-D
S: Hmm.	B-OO
L: Because it has to stretch.	B-D
F: Yeah I don’t think it's gonna stretch.	I-D
L: Okay. Well...okay...well.	B-OO
S: Wait can I try again for a second?	I-OO
L: Can we just check the programing  first and then we’ll.	I-OO
S: Okay, (?) to mess around with the plough again.	B-D
L: Yeah. (?).	B-OO
F: Sure I’d save it, did you download it?	B-QS
S: No.	B-OO
F: Okay...alright, it's the same file I think.	B-QS
L: (Let me check).	B-OO
F: Wait, it's gonna go over all the wires.	B-A
L: No because it goes backwards now.	B-ATO
F: Oh right.	B-OO
L: Oh we need to add the forward.	B-ATO
F: Yeah. What do you mean the forward? What?	I-ATO
L: Make it go forward.	I-ATO
F: Oh yeah you will, wait let’s try it again I wanna see where it...	B-OO
L: On the.	I-OO
F: No I wanna see what it does just for a second how much of a revolution it doesn’t finish.  You can have it do a full revolution so it's going forwards again rather than backwards, but I don’t know if we really need that.	B-ATV
L: Well now it is going forwards.	B-DO
F: Alright do you want to try it with the actual things?	B-OO
L: Sure.	I-OO
S: Oh guys there is a (?).	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah, what?	I-OO
F: I think there are things that can be used as ploughs I see that they have the thing that looks more ploughish.  Do you want me to just ask?  Lyn do you to just ask if there are plough like things that we can use or if all of these are...because we, because they have a thing that looks more like a plough on theirs.	B-D
F: What there?	B-OO
L: I think we can use anything.	B-D
F: Do you want to ask how they did that? It's fine.  How did you guys make that kind of plough thing for it?	I-D
KLB: This is our trial and error...	O
F: Oh cool.	B-OO
KLB: ...you kind of just (?) works.	O
F: Yeah, cool, oh so it’s like a bunch of those connector things I thought you had like a solid piece or something but that cool.	B-D
KLB: No, we (?).	O
F: That’s awesome, alright, so I think that, I think we can, you see what they did with the white things.	B-D
L: Yeah, well let’s check this first because that (?).	B-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
M: How’s it going over here?	O
KLB: Alright.	O
M: Which mission?	O
KLB: Erm, well we’re trying to do the balls.	O
L: Oh you’re doing it this way, yeah this is best.	B-A
KLB: (?) fish and we’re trying to get the corn in that ball.	O
F: Wait (?). No it goes this way.	B-A
L: No that’s how we started remember.	I-A
F: No it's...	B-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
F: Oh it doesn’t, oh.	B-NSTO
L: There we go. But now they’re stuck.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah. But...alright cool it works.	B-NSTO
M: So I talked to one team before about trying to put a whole bunch of missions in one program, can you see why that might be a problem.	O
F: If one of them messes up then all of them mess up.	B-OO
M: Right, right so you may wanna, you know one or two I think works if you start to do three, four, five then if you get tripped up somewhere along the way...	O
F: So you’d want to have it go back to the base so you can start a new one or something?	B-OO
M: Yeah have it go back to base and then start a new (?).	O
F: Alright, cool.	B-OO
M: (?) with a different name.	O
F: We just made it go in reverse you can do that instead of, like the speed thing, like the default is if you do it at negative fifty for like the speed of it it’ll just go backwards.	B-ATV
L: Okay, lets (complete)...	B-OO
F: Alright, it seems to knock it over better when it's going backwards.	B-DO
L: Yeah I think we don’t actually need a plough.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: I think we’re good.	I-OO
F: It would be cool to have one though, I don’t know how much extra friction that would add though.	B-D
L: Yeah I mean...	B-OO
S: Well we don’t actually need to touch the ground, we don’t, you just need it not close enough to the ground that it will push the thing.	B-D
F: Yeah cool.	B-OO
F: Okay, Fiona are you ready to add the rest of the program?	I-OO
F: Have you done anything yet Sarah with the programing stuff?	I-OO
S: Gave you suggestions.	I-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: Gave you suggestions.	I-OO
F: Yeah but...	I-OO
L: Do you know how the program works?	I-OO
F: ...do you want to actually do it?	I-OO
L: Yeah like do you know how to...	I-OO
F: Okay if you don’t want to do it you don’t have to but it would be cool for you to try some stuff.	I-OO
S: Hmm, maybe.	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
S: Okay	I-OO
F: (So when we get), alright so instead of this last rotation is one point three five, so instead of it being a little rotation we want to rotate all the way round and go back to base.	B-ATV
S: Yes, so you’re gonna want a tank one.	B-ATO
F: So, like three. Right. Let’s see how much that actually rotates it.	B-ATV
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Oh that’s, wait, wait.	B-NSTO
S: Two.	B-ATV
F: We’ll try it with two.	I-ATV
S: Try two.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: If that’s not enough we do like two point five or something.	B-ATV
F: Yeah I bet it’ll be enough.	B-OO
L: No, remember...when we were doing the turn before it went too far anyway so we need to be shorter I think	B-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: One point five, I mean one point, no one point seventy five.	B-ATV
F: One. Let’s try one, I think we had...but we’ll try different things too.	B-OO
S: One point seventy five.	B-ATV
L: Yeah that’s perfect.	B-DO
S: Really?	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Because I think it wanted to go, alright.	B-A
L: I think.	I-A
F: Alright, well lets just try, lets just try that but if we need it move more, alright move tank is the next, no wait it connects.  Okay, so we want it to go, so at that point   we still want it to be going backwards right?	B-ATO
L: No, I think it's okay if it goes forward because we want it to go this way.	I-ATO
F: Yeah. but that’s backwards anyway, because this is backwards (?).	I-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
: Okay.	O
F: And then how many revolutions do you think we need, like three?	B-ATV
L: What?	B-OO
F: Two or three to get back.	B-ATV
L: No, I think it's like two.	I-ATV
L: Oh facing the wrong direction ha ha.	B-A
F: Whatever.	B-OO
L: Yeah that should work okay.	I-OO
F: Alright, lets download that.	I-OO
L: Okay, lets check it...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: ...Sarah do you want to come and see it?	I-OO
S: Sure.	I-OO
F: Cool.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Wait.	I-OO
F: Wait we want to have it be facing this way, right.	B-A
L: Yeah, but wait don’t...	B-OO
F: Okay. Wait...no, no, no that’s the old one.	I-OO
L: Yeah that’s right. Oh	I-OO
F: Back...	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Back, what?	I-OO
L: No, no wait.	I-OO
F: Oh wait.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
L: No, no. It's here, (?)	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Oh yeah it's Banbury Cheese underscore	I-OO
L: Okay, here we go, like right there?	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: We need a plough.	B-D
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: No I don’t...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I don’t (?). Yeah okay.	I-OO
F: Yeah go ahead.	I-OO
L: I don’t think we need a plough Sarah (?).	B-D
S: I’ll put this back for you guys.	B-OO
F: It’ll be cool to have one but I don’t think we need it.	B-D
L: I don’t think it really serves a purpose, it would look cool but...	I-D
S: Yeah but you need something to scrape them with?	I-D
L: Well I don’t think we were going to try to scrape them back.	I-D
F: Because I, for any of them to count all of them need to be back, so it's a little bit tedious (?) that.	B-A
L: Yeah. Okay, so...that one needs to turn more.	B-ATO
F: Alright so does this one, this turn needs to be less or more?	I-ATO
S: More.	I-ATO
F: One point two five maybe?	B-ATV
L: Yeah, let me, lets see...	B-OO
F: Yeah plug it back.	I-OO
L: ...what it looks like.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Can we start making the next sequence after this?	I-OO
F: Yeah totally.	I-OO
L: Yeah, once we get the first one done then yeah, the next, you have the plan there right?	I-OO
S: Yes I've got the plan for our third sequence yes.	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Although the third sequence follows part of the, second sequence is throughout but only for a little while.	B-A
L: We need less of a turn at the last.	B-ATO
F: Okay, less of a turn?	I-ATO
L: Yeah.  So try like forty five.	B-ATV
F: One?	I-ATV
L: No.	B-OO
S: What, what, what do you mean? Less of a turn?	B-ATO
L: Yeah so not like...	I-ATO
F: What, do you want to do it?	B-OO
L: ..not even one.	B-ATV
F: What?	B-OO
L: Less than one.	B-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Fiona if I were to show this to you (?).	I-OO
F: And then I should make, you should make this one more.	B-ATV
L: What Sarah?	B-OO
S: Fiona if I was to show you (?) some random (?) would you understand it?	I-OO
F: If you explained it to me I would probably get it, but...	I-OO
S: (Now)	I-OO
L: I don’t think we need more though because it...	B-ATO
F: I think but, if it has more to go diagonally it will need to go a little more.	I-ATO
L: Well it was almost (at the wall before).	B-DO
F: Yeah but we had a bigger turn, so this way instead of it having to go straightish to the base it’ll be going more diagonal so...	B-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: ...I don’t know let’s just try it, alright.	I-OO
F: That should be good.	I-OO
L: Can we have like (?) have one point five like one point eight, maybe two point...	B-ATV
F: Two five.	I-ATV
L: ...two five yeah.	I-ATV
F: Yeah. Ah what did I do? (?).	B-NSTO
F: No not twenty two point five.	B-ATV
L: That would be a little bit too far.	B-OO
F: A little too far, okay.	I-OO
S: I'm gonna draw a kitty.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: A piglet?	I-OO
S: A kitty.	I-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
S: How did you get piglet out of kitty?	I-OO
L: It sounded like you said piglet.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Yeah that should be good.	I-OO
S: So, save it?	I-OO
F: Lets download it.	I-OO
S: There, I drew a piglet...	I-OO
L: Okay lets check...	I-OO
S: And now for my kitty.	I-OO
L: Sarah want to come and watch it move?	I-OO

L: Yes.	B-OO
T: Oh.	O
L: Ok it needs to go further.	B-DO
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just a tiny bit though.	B-DO
S: Put it back to it's orig-	B-A
L: Hold on.	B-OO
S: Or we could just like take that of, or we could just like scooch that down so it only catching on that thing, so...	B-A
L: Yeah	B-OO
T: Well if it kept going...	O
F: L- Lyn	B-L
L: Yeah it needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Lets start it here I think we had it scooched in a little bit too, so lets just start it at the edge this time.	B-A
S: Remember when it caught on the edge of the frame.	B-DO
L: Yeah we switched it since, that’s why.	I-DO
S: Well you could just remove those extra little bits that it caught on.	B-D
F: Oh whoops, what did it do?	B-NSTO
L: Huh	I-NSTO
F: That was weird.	I-NSTO
L: Okay try placing it here.	B-A
S: I think we could just remove those guys um and put it back to the place when it was catching on the frame, because those guys were really what got caught.	B-D
S: It needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Why’s it suddenly, that’s weird.	B-NSTO
L: Where are you placing (?)	B-A
S: I think you have it closer right here.	I-A
T: (Move it towards the edge)	O
F: Move it towards the edge maybe.	B-A
T: Worth a try.	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay it just needs to go further.	B-DO
T: That’s brilliant.	B-OO
F: Yay it’s working.	B-NSTO
T: And you had the wheel right on...	O
F: On, the black yeah. Yay.	B-A
L: Okay so one more...	B-OO
S: Wait wait wait Lyn I need to see something come back.	I-OO
L: Because what?	I-OO
S: (?) how far will it need to go past here? Because it needs a loop round this.	B-DO
L: I think it needs two more.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I was looking at that before, I think it needs two more.	I-ATV
F: Sarah you should do some of the programing because I feel like it's me and Lyn doing a lot of it and you’re getting bored so.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: You should probably do some stuff.	I-OO
S: How does half this stuff work.	I-OO
L: Okay so (?)	B-P
F: I’ll sit here I guess	I-P
F: Alright so you probably wanna drag, see how the revolutions is set to two there,	B-ATV
S: Hm mm	B-OO
F: Double click on that?	I-OO
L: No	I-OO
F: No that’s the wrong clicker. Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: And then...	I-OO
L: We get (?)	I-OO
F: ...delete it, it's the backspace on here.	B-QS
L: Wait, no make it four or three point five.	B-ATV
S: Is that a three point five?	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: And then next one?	I-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: Then the next one is a turn.	B-ATO
F: So you only want to do that one.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: (?) (to load?)	I-OO
L: Yeah. And you want it to be a C.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Port C. And um one is correct, so you just leave that, okay and then the next one is two.	B-ATV
F: And move tank yeah.	B-ATO
L: Yeah move tank to two.	B-ATV
F: Make sure you’re...	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: (?)	I-OO
L: (?). Yeah. Yeah, watch where the one is.	B-ATV
S: What do you want me to do?	B-OO
L: Two.	B-ATV
S: Any good?	B-OO
L: Huh, huh	I-OO
S: Right the next one,	I-OO
F: You wanna try it? Lets make it, lets do a test.	I-OO
L: Okay. So, so that (?).	I-OO
F: ... is the download button.	B-QS
L: Oh yeah.	B-OO
F: Oh it's not plugged in.	B-QS
L: No it is, yeah. Just click it together, you don’t keep it down just. Yeah. Okay. Right.	I-QS
F: Alright so we need to make sure that this is...	B-OO
L: Yeah, well (?).	I-OO
F: (Over) there	I-OO
L: Let me try (?)	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah.	I-OO
F: Oh...	I-OO
L: No it was at different spot, it wa- I think it was further back.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Or more to the side of something.	B-A
T: (?) (could count on the little mark).	O
F: Yeah I'm setting it back to one tick mark kind of and (?) the side.  It's not gonna work.	B-A
L: Okay	B-NSTO
S: It was working before though.	I-NSTO
F: Yeah maybe just need to make it go a little further before it turns, I think that might just be the solution	B-DO
S: Well it, it worked before so where were you do you think?	B-NSTO
L: Maybe it was like more kind of like...	B-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
L: No.	I-OO
F: No	I-OO
S: What happened it isn’t going as far as it was?	B-DO
F: Alright, we can also just change the programming instead of figuring out where exactly the (?).	B-A
S: Yeah lets have it go farther.	B-DO
S: Wait, wait, wait you need to see which one it was again.	I-DO
F: I know which one it was.	I-DO
L: It was	B-OO
F: Yeah, we know, so...yeah.	I-OO
S: Agh (sorry)	I-OO
F: It was on,	I-OO
L: Wait	I-OO
F: Okay so (?).	I-OO
S: Which one was it?	I-OO
F: It was okay, don’t sh...okay so it went forward and then it turned then it went forward and then it...not that one I think it's that one.	B-ATO
L: (That) one	I-ATO
S: Which one?	I-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
S: This one? Which one?	I-ATO
L: Yeah the one that you’re just on yes, yes.	I-ATO
S: So...	B-OO
L: Three...	B-ATV
F: Click yeah/ No don’t make it two make it like two point seven five.	I-ATV
L: Okay and now just save it.	B-QS
F: Yeah, yeah no, no	B-OO
L: No	I-OO
F: You don’t need to do that.	I-OO
L: As in like download it.	I-OO
F: Download it.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: You okay sleepy?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay lets go and try.	I-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
F: (?) was in that gallery walk and (?) gallery walk,	I-OO
S: I'm pretty sure it (?) gallery walk.	I-OO
L: Elsie, Matthew, Marcus and Ian I think were all there.	I-OO
S: Really anybody outside you and Else ever invites me anywhere. (?) school	I-OO
F: Alright I'm setting it back to the second one because I feel like...	B-A
S: Lyn, really anybody besides you and Elsie ever invites me an- outside our school ever invites me anywhere.	B-OO
F: Oh, whoops alright. Can you grab it so that its (?).	B-NSTO
S: What went wrong?	I-NSTO
F: I’ll just set it further back or further.	B-DO
S: Are you sure it was that turn and not the other one?	I-DO
L: Yeah I think it was wrong on.	I-DO
F: Hey, taking more than one. What?	B-OO
L: No.	I-OO
T: (?) if it makes you feel better	O
L: Lets, no lets see this.	B-OO
T: Alright never mind	O
L: Yeah okay (?) ditch this from two point five back to, two point...	B-ATV
F: You’re clicking the wrong button.	B-QS
S: Wait, so what?	B-OO
F: What Lyn I don’t think she understands you.	I-OO
L: You switch it to two point, two five. Two five.	B-QTV
F: Put a two there. Okay.	I-QTV
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: I think it was one	B-QTV
L: This one I think should be two, I think that’s where I went wrong.	I-QTV
L: Okay, did you save it?	B-OO
F: Yeah. Click it,	B-QS
L: You just (?) you go.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: I did click it though.	B-QS
L: Yeah you just don’t hold it down the whole time.	I-QS
S: I didn’t hold it down.	I-QS
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay. We can change the starting position a little bit.	B-AS
S: Two point twen- Or not. No it needs to be further ahead.	B-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Further ahead.	B-A
L: Than it was at the start so like, whatever	I-A
F: Oh. Oh.	B-NSTO
S: Just remove those things on the edges and you’ll be fine.	B-D
F: Yeah, do we need to have those?	I-D
S: No we don’t.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: They’re just useless little things that are just sitting there.	B-D
L: (?) whatever.	B-OO
F: Okay. Alright.	I-OO
L: You started the wrong spot I think.	B-A
F: Yeah, okay. Why is it doing that?	B-NSTO
L: I think you need it more forward, I think it just (?).	B-A
S: Are you sure it's straight?	I-A
F: It's mostly straight.	I-A
L: Lets switch the distance here.	B-DO
F: (?) tiny a bit shorter, because two point five can just be like two point four.	B-ATV
S: Two point four?	I-ATV
L: No, no.	B-OO
S: This one or which one?	I-OO
T: You guys take a fresh air break (?).	O
S: Oh fresh air (?)	B-OO
T: (?) fresh air (?	O
L: Yeah make this one point...	B-ATV
F: Nine?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Alright. And we need to plug it in.	B-QS
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah yeah.	I-OO
L: And save.	B-QS
F: Oh wait is it plugged in	I-QS
L: Yeah that’s right.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Sarah.	I-OO
F: Yeah. Just lightly tap it.	B-QS
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Where’s the other one of these? Oh Lyn we should probably put these back to where we got them from so we don’t lose them.	B-D
L: Why didn’t you just put them up next to the computer incase we need them?	I-D
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Ha ha ha ha	B-OO
L: Okay lets go.	I-OO
F: Oh yeah. Okay Banbury Cheese, Banbury Two. What?	B-QS
S: It's too far.	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Lets just (?).	I-OO
S: So we shrunk it and yet it went further.	B-DO
L: Well that won’t increase like that wont help.	I-DO
F: It should.	B-OO
L: No because it's the turn that’s the problem I think.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay, here.	I-OO
S: Change positions again?	B-A
L: Yeah, no like here I think one more time.	B-AE
F: Here.	B-A
L: Yes.	B-OO
S: You’re having a second...	I-OO
F: Don’t worry.	I-OO
GS1: But I want to suggest something.	O
F: Sure.	B-OO
GS1: What are you trying to get?	O
F: We’re, we’re not there but we’re trying to, right now we’re basically just trying to make this turn work.	B-OO
GS1: You keep running it over here you should maybe like stop this way...	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
GS1: ...so then you can turn (?).	O
S: That’s what we, that’s we’re trying to do but the...	B-OO
F: That’s what we’re	I-OO
S: ...but the	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
S: Um but the distance is off (?) though	B-DO
F: Yeah the distance is off	I-DO
L: We did.	B-OO
F: We did	I-OO
L: It just needs to be (?) a little more I think.	B-DO
S: So one point eight instead?	B-ATV
L: Well maybe it’s just	B-OO
L: Yay, wait wrong direction.It could turn back there but we knocked these off.	B-A
S: Remember that spot Fiona.	I-A
F: Alright you guys can use it now.	B-OO
S: Remember that spot.	B-A
F: Yeah. Yeah it worked you just need to like line it up a certain way.	I-A
S: Fiona we should also have (?), why don’t after we switch the distance we also check on, on Banbury one.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: You gonna switch distance Sarah or do you want Fiona to do it? Sarah.	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
L: Since you’ve been doing the distance (?) are you gonna do it? Or do you want us to do it.	I-OO
S: I’ll do it.	I-OO
F: Alright cool. Ha ha ha	I-OO
S: You know you can’t make weird noises like I can. (growling noise).	I-OO
L: (noise)	I-OO
S: Not like that.	I-OO
L: Try seven. Okay and save it.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: Alright.	I-OO
F: Do you want to stay here Sarah if you’re feeling tired?	I-OO
S: No I'm good.	I-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: I'm good.	I-OO
L: What’s wrong Sarah?	I-OO
S: Nothing.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Just sleepy. Do you want to try the first one also?	I-OO
L: Yeah why not. Okay.	I-OO
F: We’re starting it like...	B-A
S: Your mom’s trying to convince us to get fresh air.	B-OO
F: Yeah wait...	I-OO
S: Banbury one.	I-OO
F: I lost something,	I-OO
L: What did  you lose?	I-OO
F: Project, okay Banbury Cheese, okay there we go, oh whoops I forgot that it goes backwards.	B-QS
S: (?) on your arm Fiona, okay.	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: Okay. What? Ha ha ha Okay	B-NSTO
F: Oh yeah we had it further back, you should remember that.	B-A
S: Now you mention it.	B-OO
H: You should get extra points for that for flipping it over.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah. Ten points.	I-OO
L: Okay. These are all falling out now.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: God Fiona.	I-OO
F: I think we had it like that.	B-A
L: What?	B-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
L: No.	I-OO
S: No...you’re meant to go and knock it over you silly little thing.	B-D
F: Okay. Sarah don’t think shouting at it is gonna do it any good.	B-OO
S: It works for diff- other things, (?) it works for me.	I-OO
F: Perfect.	B-NSTO
S: Okay so she claims.	B-OO
F: Shut up Sarah. No.	I-OO
S: Sarah has lots of  good points of view, she also has a handful of bacteria. Don’t mess with her.	I-OO
L: Sarah can the handful of bacteria go in?	I-OO
S: You left one.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Don’t worry we get (?) in a minute.	I-OO
F: Okay. Lets line up this with the (?).	B-A
L: Yes, maybe.	B-NSTO
S: Yes, yes, yes...	I-NSTO
F: Yay.	B-OO
L: Okay good.	I-OO
F: Okay it works.	B-NSTO
L: Alright.	B-OO
S: Okay it's all yours.	I-OO
F: Just need to have it lined up.	B-A
GS1: I have a question.	O
S: yeah	B-OO
GS1: So you guys getting those that one and that one and this one.	O
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: Yeah hopefully	I-OO
F: We’re having it as two separate things though. So	I-OO
S: Yeah so...	I-OO
F: So  that if it messes up the...	I-OO
GS2: (?).	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
GS2: Make it separate (?) you know what I mean.	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
GS2: Make it a separate mission.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Do you mind if we test out er one thing really quick?	I-OO
GS2: No that’s fine.	O
F: Thanks, er right where was it lined up?	B-A
L: It was lined up that way	I-A
F: It was like...?  It was this way, I think that it was on the first one.	I-A
L: Yeah there we go.	B-NSTO
F: Okay. Oh no.	I-NSTO
S: I think it was further forwards.	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright, this way.	B-A
S: I'm sorry we’re taking so long.	B-OO
GS1: It's alright.	O
S: No, no further forward.	B-A
F: Forward?	I-A
S: Yeah because it (?)	I-A
F: It has to be (?) it has to be inside of the thing though.	I-A
L: I think Fiona it was over that way more. Yeah there we go.	I-A
T: (If you figure it out) you should draw a little diagram of where it should be.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I already did so...	I-OO
F: No you	I-OO
S: (?) thing	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay, let’s.	I-OO
F: Yes that’s what I was thinking	I-OO
L: Lets let them go.	I-OO
F: Yes.	I-OO
S: Yeah	I-OO
F: Sorry we took a long time. God damn it the ball was everywhere now.	I-OO
S: Where’s my map go?	I-OO
F: Okay we should draw on the back of it where it should be for the start again. So, I’m number one  number two...	B-A
S: Notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch.	I-A
F: Okay we don’t need them (?).	B-OO
S: I'm making more notch’s shoosh.	B-A
F: Artistic licence.	B-OO
L: Okay Fiona, wanna start programing the rest of two, Sarah you’re working on the notch map.	I-OO
