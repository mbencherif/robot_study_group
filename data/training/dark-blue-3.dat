L: Okay. Well...	B-OO
F: You can use it.	I-OO
S: Why is it running over the lever?	B-DO
F: That was so weird it worked the first time and then it didn’t work at all after that.	I-DO
S: Yeah the lever had a little...	B-A
T: Do you think you need a little plough kinda thing?	O
L: Well we’re making one but that’s not going to affect it.	B-D
F: That’s not the problem it's not about...	B-DO
S: Okay I have an idea for the plough.	B-D
F: ...it's about not being able to run over it, it's just running over the lever instead of actually pushing it.	B-DO
S: We want something for the back or the front?	B-D
L: The back.	I-D
F: The back.	I-D
L: Back.	I-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay lets figure out how to back this thing up now.	B-ATO
S: Okay if we’re gonna have something to the back then we’re gonna (?).	B-D
F: Okay	B-OO
L: I don’t see where the connection to the back, lets just make it to the front.	B-D
L: Okay. Fiona let’s figure how to back this up	B-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: You got a plan Sarah you said?	B-A
S: For a plough?	B-D
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I’m trying to figure it out now but (?). Put it down.	B-D
S: Hold on we’re, Fiona’s setting something up right now Sarah and it's not going to help if you keep on smacking the table because I'm not going to listen to you people again.	B-OO
S: Lyn don’t mess with me I have plastic.	I-OO
L: Sarah don’t mess with me I'm sick and I'm getting grouchy, I will lick you.	I-OO
S: You realize you have my sickness right?	I-OO
L: Yes I know.	I-OO
S: And I’ve given it to you so it wouldn’t really matter if you lick my face or not.	I-OO
F: Okay, yeah.	I-OO
S: All you’ll really be doing is taking from the (?)orginal source.	I-OO
F: Move your foot	I-OO
S: My foot was there first.	I-OO
F: So it should move back two probably or three.	B-ATV
S: Okay, let me check out whether this plough thing’s gonna work.	B-D
F: Alright I'm gonna, do you want to move it back to start?	B-A
L: Yeah, okay.	B-OO
S: Well lets see this plough. Oh (?).	B-D
L: Okay and then turn, that’s okay so you have...	B-DO
S: I say stick these two here.	B-D
L: This is the right side has to turn.	B-ATO
F: Alright so that one is B or C? I think it's B.	B-ATV
L: No I think it might C.	I-ATV
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Okay, go ahead and try it now, Sarah (your lights) might want to look out.	I-OO
S: (I don’t stretch this far).	I-OO
L: Yeah there we go.	B-NSTO
S: Okay let me test this.	B-OO
F: I thought we might want to do it (?)	B-A
L: Okay. And then...	B-OO
F: This needs to be like one...	B-ATV
S: Let me test, let me test (?) t t t t t t.	B-OO
L: Okay (?) Fiona	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Sarah I have to set it out.	I-OO
S: No.	I-OO
L: Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah. No.	I-OO
S: I'm trying to make you a plough here it's what you wanted me to do isn’t it?	B-D
F: Okay lets, lets make the plough.	I-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Okay should we use these like little (?) things?	B-D
L: What?	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: What do you mean (?)? No it should be in the um back.	B-D
S: We (can’t) attach to back.	I-D
L: Well it needs...	I-D
S: There’s no easy way to attach it.	I-D
L: ...because, well it only works in the back is the thing.	I-D
S: We could get it to turn a whole circle though?	B-A
L: No we don’t have enough room.	I-A
S: Okay, so lets, you know pull this one out.  We want, if we’re gonna do actually...oh, what is this right here?	B-D
L: It's um.	B-OO
F: Guys we could start it backwards and then make it go forwards,	B-ATO
L: That would be	B-OO
F: We could reverse everything and make all of it negative.	B-ATV
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: So we just start it backwards.	B-A
L: Okay lets do it that way.	B-OO
F: Negative fifty, no, no one fifty negative fifty	B-ATV
S: Why is my foot warm?	B-OO
F: ...negative.	B-ATV
L: I don’t know Sarah did your foot pee?	B-OO
S: No I don’t think so, but feel it.	I-OO
L: Probably because you were just sitting on it.	I-OO
S: Sure. Be a critic.	I-OO
L: What? What you asked for an answer, I think that’s the most logical thing is (?).	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
S: They have the bionic, bionical bulldogs and we’ve got cheese.	I-OO
F: We decided (?)	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: ...so that we start it in reverse so we can go forward and have the plough be going forward.	B-ATO
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Hopefully it works, so we’re gonna start it backwards.	B-ATO
L: Yeah okay, Sarah do you mind moving your...	B-OO
F: Sarah your (?).	I-OO
L: Okay. What?	I-OO
F: We can just reverse the, this just needs to be B, that one...	B-ATV
L: They both need to be B.	I-ATV
S: Wait pass me my pen.	B-OO
F: Okay (?).	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Okay, Lyn, Fiona look at this design for the plough.	B-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: So we used some of these rocks here as like the things that scrape on the ground and they’re connected to the bars, wait pull up this thing and you’re connected to these things right here somehow.	B-D
L: Do these (?)?	B-OO
F: No they don’t have.	B-D
S: They have to be connected with something.	I-D
L: But they don’t connect is the problem.	I-D
S: Not, no, no, no not there, in here, put it down like on the table.	I-D
L: Oh we could use these red ones.	I-D
S: That’s why I pulled them out.	I-D
L: Yeah or (?).	B-OO
S: Might (?) light blue ones.	B-D
L: No, no it’s good, okay.	B-OO
S: And then we string a bar between the two of them.	B-D
L: Okay here good, a red one, do we need, oh yeah we should have a bar. (?) Do you want this? No never.	I-D
S: Wait, wait we could have, hmm, we could have it like that.	I-D
L: Yeah maybe that would work okay, wait so...like...	I-D
S: No, no, no, no like a (?).	B-OO
L: Yeah I'm going to connect it and then you...	B-D
S: No, no we cant, no we cant.	B-OO
L: ...no I'm going to connect it then you (?).	B-D
S: No you’re putting it on backwards, oh wait actually that would work better.	I-D
L: Well you can always twist it that’s the thing.	I-D
S: Yeah but you guys want to put them on the same because that one’s backwards compared to the other one...See what I mean, they’re backwards.	I-D
L: Hmm. Lets see. (?)...okay.	B-OO
F: I'm gonna bring a chair over because I'm too lazy to stand.	I-OO
S: We want to use one of these really long ones and we want to put them in one of the lower ones.	B-D
F: It's kind of annoying that we don’t have actual lego bricks...	I-D
S: Yeah.	B-OO
F: ...because that would (build it) really easy.	B-D
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Yeah that one needs to be...	B-D
L: Okay, like this Sarah?	I-D
S: Lets see, I had it like, I'm sure I had it like, dip, dip, dip, dip...	I-D
F: But I thought you were making it the same way?	I-D
S: (?) this.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Here. Okay.	I-OO
T: (?)you guys are adding sensors?	O
F: We’re making a plough.	B-D
T: Oh good.	O
S: And there we go.	B-D
L: Oh sorry.	B-OO
S: I think we’re blocking the camera.	I-OO
F: Oh. I can move.	I-OO
R: You don’t have to worry about that.	O
S: No not you. I think all of us are. And then bar in-between and then (?), and then it doesn’t need to be that high, too high off the ground. Is it falling off real easily?	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Sarah I don’t think this (make) is gonna work.	B-D
S: Hmm.	B-OO
L: Because it has to stretch.	B-D
F: Yeah I don’t think it's gonna stretch.	I-D
L: Okay. Well...okay...well.	B-OO
S: Wait can I try again for a second?	I-OO
L: Can we just check the programing  first and then we’ll.	I-OO
S: Okay, (?) to mess around with the plough again.	B-D
L: Yeah. (?).	B-OO
F: Sure I’d save it, did you download it?	B-QS
S: No.	B-OO
F: Okay...alright, it's the same file I think.	B-QS
L: (Let me check).	B-OO
F: Wait, it's gonna go over all the wires.	B-A
L: No because it goes backwards now.	B-ATO
F: Oh right.	B-OO
L: Oh we need to add the forward.	B-ATO
F: Yeah. What do you mean the forward? What?	I-ATO
L: Make it go forward.	I-ATO
F: Oh yeah you will, wait let’s try it again I wanna see where it...	B-OO
L: On the.	I-OO
F: No I wanna see what it does just for a second how much of a revolution it doesn’t finish.  You can have it do a full revolution so it's going forwards again rather than backwards, but I don’t know if we really need that.	B-ATV
L: Well now it is going forwards.	B-DO
F: Alright do you want to try it with the actual things?	B-OO
L: Sure.	I-OO
S: Oh guys there is a (?).	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah, what?	I-OO
F: I think there are things that can be used as ploughs I see that they have the thing that looks more ploughish.  Do you want me to just ask?  Lyn do you to just ask if there are plough like things that we can use or if all of these are...because we, because they have a thing that looks more like a plough on theirs.	B-D
F: What there?	B-OO
L: I think we can use anything.	B-D
F: Do you want to ask how they did that? It's fine.  How did you guys make that kind of plough thing for it?	I-D
KLB: This is our trial and error...	O
F: Oh cool.	B-OO
KLB: ...you kind of just (?) works.	O
F: Yeah, cool, oh so it’s like a bunch of those connector things I thought you had like a solid piece or something but that cool.	B-D
KLB: No, we (?).	O
F: That’s awesome, alright, so I think that, I think we can, you see what they did with the white things.	B-D
L: Yeah, well let’s check this first because that (?).	B-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
M: How’s it going over here?	O
KLB: Alright.	O
M: Which mission?	O
KLB: Erm, well we’re trying to do the balls.	O
L: Oh you’re doing it this way, yeah this is best.	B-A
KLB: (?) fish and we’re trying to get the corn in that ball.	O
F: Wait (?). No it goes this way.	B-A
L: No that’s how we started remember.	I-A
F: No it's...	B-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
F: Oh it doesn’t, oh.	B-NSTO
L: There we go. But now they’re stuck.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah. But...alright cool it works.	B-NSTO
M: So I talked to one team before about trying to put a whole bunch of missions in one program, can you see why that might be a problem.	O
F: If one of them messes up then all of them mess up.	B-OO
M: Right, right so you may wanna, you know one or two I think works if you start to do three, four, five then if you get tripped up somewhere along the way...	O
F: So you’d want to have it go back to the base so you can start a new one or something?	B-OO
M: Yeah have it go back to base and then start a new (?).	O
F: Alright, cool.	B-OO
M: (?) with a different name.	O
F: We just made it go in reverse you can do that instead of, like the speed thing, like the default is if you do it at negative fifty for like the speed of it it’ll just go backwards.	B-ATV
L: Okay, lets (complete)...	B-OO
F: Alright, it seems to knock it over better when it's going backwards.	B-DO
L: Yeah I think we don’t actually need a plough.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: I think we’re good.	I-OO
F: It would be cool to have one though, I don’t know how much extra friction that would add though.	B-D
L: Yeah I mean...	B-OO
S: Well we don’t actually need to touch the ground, we don’t, you just need it not close enough to the ground that it will push the thing.	B-D
F: Yeah cool.	B-OO
F: Okay, Fiona are you ready to add the rest of the program?	I-OO
F: Have you done anything yet Sarah with the programing stuff?	I-OO
S: Gave you suggestions.	I-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: Gave you suggestions.	I-OO
F: Yeah but...	I-OO
L: Do you know how the program works?	I-OO
F: ...do you want to actually do it?	I-OO
L: Yeah like do you know how to...	I-OO
F: Okay if you don’t want to do it you don’t have to but it would be cool for you to try some stuff.	I-OO
S: Hmm, maybe.	I-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
S: Okay	I-OO
F: (So when we get), alright so instead of this last rotation is one point three five, so instead of it being a little rotation we want to rotate all the way round and go back to base.	B-ATV
S: Yes, so you’re gonna want a tank one.	B-ATO
F: So, like three. Right. Let’s see how much that actually rotates it.	B-ATV
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Oh that’s, wait, wait.	B-NSTO
S: Two.	B-ATV
F: We’ll try it with two.	I-ATV
S: Try two.	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: If that’s not enough we do like two point five or something.	B-ATV
F: Yeah I bet it’ll be enough.	B-OO
L: No, remember...when we were doing the turn before it went too far anyway so we need to be shorter I think	B-ATO
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: One point five, I mean one point, no one point seventy five.	B-ATV
F: One. Let’s try one, I think we had...but we’ll try different things too.	B-OO
S: One point seventy five.	B-ATV
L: Yeah that’s perfect.	B-DO
S: Really?	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Because I think it wanted to go, alright.	B-A
L: I think.	I-A
F: Alright, well lets just try, lets just try that but if we need it move more, alright move tank is the next, no wait it connects.  Okay, so we want it to go, so at that point   we still want it to be going backwards right?	B-ATO
L: No, I think it's okay if it goes forward because we want it to go this way.	I-ATO
F: Yeah. but that’s backwards anyway, because this is backwards (?).	I-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
: Okay.	O
F: And then how many revolutions do you think we need, like three?	B-ATV
L: What?	B-OO
F: Two or three to get back.	B-ATV
L: No, I think it's like two.	I-ATV
L: Oh facing the wrong direction ha ha.	B-A
F: Whatever.	B-OO
L: Yeah that should work okay.	I-OO
F: Alright, lets download that.	I-OO
L: Okay, lets check it...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: ...Sarah do you want to come and see it?	I-OO
S: Sure.	I-OO
F: Cool.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Wait.	I-OO
F: Wait we want to have it be facing this way, right.	B-A
L: Yeah, but wait don’t...	B-OO
F: Okay. Wait...no, no, no that’s the old one.	I-OO
L: Yeah that’s right. Oh	I-OO
F: Back...	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Back, what?	I-OO
L: No, no wait.	I-OO
F: Oh wait.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Er	I-OO
L: No, no. It's here, (?)	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Oh yeah it's Banbury Cheese underscore	I-OO
L: Okay, here we go, like right there?	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: We need a plough.	B-D
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: No I don’t...	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I don’t (?). Yeah okay.	I-OO
F: Yeah go ahead.	I-OO
L: I don’t think we need a plough Sarah (?).	B-D
S: I’ll put this back for you guys.	B-OO
F: It’ll be cool to have one but I don’t think we need it.	B-D
L: I don’t think it really serves a purpose, it would look cool but...	I-D
S: Yeah but you need something to scrape them with?	I-D
L: Well I don’t think we were going to try to scrape them back.	I-D
F: Because I, for any of them to count all of them need to be back, so it's a little bit tedious (?) that.	B-A
L: Yeah. Okay, so...that one needs to turn more.	B-ATO
F: Alright so does this one, this turn needs to be less or more?	I-ATO
S: More.	I-ATO
F: One point two five maybe?	B-ATV
L: Yeah, let me, lets see...	B-OO
F: Yeah plug it back.	I-OO
L: ...what it looks like.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Can we start making the next sequence after this?	I-OO
F: Yeah totally.	I-OO
L: Yeah, once we get the first one done then yeah, the next, you have the plan there right?	I-OO
S: Yes I've got the plan for our third sequence yes.	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Although the third sequence follows part of the, second sequence is throughout but only for a little while.	B-A
L: We need less of a turn at the last.	B-ATO
F: Okay, less of a turn?	I-ATO
L: Yeah.  So try like forty five.	B-ATV
F: One?	I-ATV
L: No.	B-OO
S: What, what, what do you mean? Less of a turn?	B-ATO
L: Yeah so not like...	I-ATO
F: What, do you want to do it?	B-OO
L: ..not even one.	B-ATV
F: What?	B-OO
L: Less than one.	B-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Fiona if I were to show this to you (?).	I-OO
F: And then I should make, you should make this one more.	B-ATV
L: What Sarah?	B-OO
S: Fiona if I was to show you (?) some random (?) would you understand it?	I-OO
F: If you explained it to me I would probably get it, but...	I-OO
S: (Now)	I-OO
L: I don’t think we need more though because it...	B-ATO
F: I think but, if it has more to go diagonally it will need to go a little more.	I-ATO
L: Well it was almost (at the wall before).	B-DO
F: Yeah but we had a bigger turn, so this way instead of it having to go straightish to the base it’ll be going more diagonal so...	B-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: ...I don’t know let’s just try it, alright.	I-OO
F: That should be good.	I-OO
L: Can we have like (?) have one point five like one point eight, maybe two point...	B-ATV
F: Two five.	I-ATV
L: ...two five yeah.	I-ATV
F: Yeah. Ah what did I do? (?).	B-NSTO
F: No not twenty two point five.	B-ATV
L: That would be a little bit too far.	B-OO
F: A little too far, okay.	I-OO
S: I'm gonna draw a kitty.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: A piglet?	I-OO
S: A kitty.	I-OO
L: Oh.	I-OO
S: How did you get piglet out of kitty?	I-OO
L: It sounded like you said piglet.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Yeah that should be good.	I-OO
S: So, save it?	I-OO
F: Lets download it.	I-OO
S: There, I drew a piglet...	I-OO
L: Okay lets check...	I-OO
S: And now for my kitty.	I-OO
L: Sarah want to come and watch it move?	I-OO
