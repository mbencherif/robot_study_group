K:  and so lets say this is right, like right here we can turn around we can kind of like push it to a wall, pop it up and then move it, like so it goes like this, down to the base.	B-A
A: Hold on	B-OO
K: So it's kind of like a little...	B-D
A: We’ll have to find a way to attach it.	I-D
K: Yeah, yeah a plough just goes like brm	I-D
G: Yeah	B-OO
K: And that would also help us if we’re trying to do the bacteria like (?).	B-A
A: Well the plough can work with the bacteria.	I-A
G: Here.	B-OO
K: Oh that’s (the scrubber) thing.	B-DO
A: That didn’t work.	B-NSTO
G: Yeah that didn’t work. Back to the drawing board.	I-NSTO
A: Wait, I have an idea, give me this stupid thing, hold on lets try it like this.	B-A
G: Wait I still need to program it.	B-OO
A: I know, one second, I'm just testing something.	I-OO
K: Um where’s the robot?	I-OO
G: She has it.	I-OO
K: Here, let me try. Let me try this. Okay.	B-A
G: The corn machine.	B-OO
K: Okay lets try this.	B-A
G: Okay go ahead.	B-OO
<singing>	O
A: Oh go go.	B-OO
K: It’s not letting me	B-QR
A: All you have to do is press the center button.	I-QR
K: It's not working.	B-NSTO
G: Can you please bring back the...	B-OO
K: We got some malfunctioning going on.	B-QR
G: Well I’ll just do another.	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: So I fixed this one I think.	B-D
A: So the (program’s) all set	B-OO
G: (I don’t think we need) this, I'm so sorry.	B-D
A: I know it's okay. We could attach it to the back.	I-D
G: I'm just gonna take this off, it’s still together.	I-D
A: See because we can have it go...okay somewhere, oh...	B-A
Spin come back, plough. Ha ha ha	I-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: I,I,I can see (?)	I-OO
G: Go I had it come down here and then turn and then it turned, so it needs to move forward once and then turn left and then move forward once. Okay so everything back in the position (?).	B-ATV
A: I will fix everything you can go on program I can fix.	B-OO
G: Okay Katie	I-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
G: I know how to fix this, excuse me.	I-OO
K: Okay. I really just want to try the program, but okay.	I-OO
G: You can program the next one when we try to figure out what we’re gonna do next.	I-OO
A: Um our robot can move the thing. We got a plough.	B-D
G: And then, this one, left and then one more...	B-ATO
A: I got it.	B-D
G: I can’t move this over.	B-QR
A: I fixed it. I think I fixed it.	B-D
K: I'm studying on how, on, where the bacteria will fall. Oh. Oh	B-A
G: No I didn’t.	B-OO
K: No. You guys have red eyes, oh can I see?	I-OO
A: (Sure.)	I-OO
K: Oh that’s so cool, that’s so cool.	I-OO
A: We’re focusing on our own.	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Because we have some issues, that we need to address...	I-OO
K: Are you borrowing this?	I-OO
DBF: (?)	O
K: Oh yeah sure.	B-OO
DBF: Thanks.	O
K: Okay so, here test it a bit to see how it will work.	B-OO
G: We need to, instead of these two, two right motions, what can we (do) that to?	B-ATO
K: We can probably make one right and one (?)the other one left.	I-ATO
G: That (instead).	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
K: Let’s try, lets test it for a sec	B-A
G: Okay	B-OO
K: And then we’ll (?). Oh, (?).	I-OO
G: (?)	I-OO
K: I can program how, we can try to get the fish.	B-A
G: You start programming one all about fish.	I-A
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: I think I figured out the plough. Now. Because now it's not touching the ground.	B-D
K: That’s fine. ((sings)) Miss Rosman how do you make it (so both) like (b and ).	B-QS
T: You, you can (shift it along).	O
K: Yeah I know how to shift it I just don’t know how to put it (both).	B-QS
T: Put it so it's right in the middle, are you trying to (are you talking about the steering).	O
K: Yeah like, no both the wheels turn the same.	B-QS
T: Both the wheels turn the same,	O
K: Hm	B-OO
T:  So if you want it to, if you want it to turn you just have to program one wheel to move faster than the other so there was...	O
K: No, no, no like how to get them both.	B-QS
T: How to get them both...	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
DBT: (?)	O
G: No.	B-OO
<laughing>	O
G: Look at this.	B-OO
T: I know that’s...	O
A: Okay here let me touch this because I fixed the plough.	B-D
G: Okay we’ll try that on it. But we still need to get the yellow ball.	B-A
A: Oh that’s what we’re trying...	I-A
G: Yeah that’s what we’re aiming for.	I-A
A: Okay let me er fix, if you grab that I can fix the corn hopper.	B-OO
G: So...okay.	I-OO
K: Hmm, what’s this, this is a sensor.	B-QS
G: Okay you put the blue back.	B-OO
A: Oh, oh my god you’ve made a mess.	I-OO
G: Oh my gosh. Look it. This is all knocked over, that was all knocked over you got the (?) off of it.	B-DO
A: Do you know how many points that is?	B-OO
G: (?) round here.	I-OO
T: Really?	O
K: Lets try that, I wanna see that.	B-OO
T: I wanna see that too.	O
G: Oh don’t forget to move the fish back.	B-OO
K: Go.	I-OO
G: Oh it didn’t work that time.	B-NSTO
K: It was it is a bit off	B-DO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: It worked that time. Oh my gosh.	B-NSTO
T: But then you would, then you would just have to figure out how to get it back to base and then you get points for that, you get points for the balls.	O
A: This didn’t go off.	B-DO
T: Yeah.	O
A: Oh my god why is this not working.	B-NSTO
T: (?) stop over there. (?) make it go backwards and then like turn (?) come this way maybe.	O
A: Yeah I’ll pick up the bacterias okay	B-OO
G: okay I'm going go finish programing, okay.	I-OO
K: I need help, how do you like make sure that both of the wheels I didn’t really catch that?	B-QS
G: But I need to do something to make sure that this will be able to come back.	B-ATO
K: Okay.	B-OO
T: (?) trying to figure out how to make (?)	O
K: No she already did that.	B-OO
T: She already did that.	O
G: I'm just want to make this page bigger but I can’t.	B-QR
T: Can you	O
G: Wait?	B-OO
T: Yeah that’s what I was wondering, that was, that’s exactly what I was thinking, (?) can you make those smaller.	O
G: So then, we should do everything in reverse.	B-ATO
K: Wait, what let me try to do this?	B-OO
G: Not now please I need to finish. Programing it to see if it...okay go ahead but I'm finishing programing it so it’ll go back to base and then we’ll get those points.	B-ATO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
G: So I need it to...	B-ATO
A: Now we got the plough working...	B-D
G: Turn around.	B-ATO
A: Go (?). Oh my god. Hold on.	B-OO
K: Just click on it or program.	B-QR
A: Okay that was not the right one.	B-NSTO
K: We think it's because...	I-NSTO
A: That’s too much. Oh. Oh	B-DO
K: Oh god. ha ha ha	B-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Okay that’s what (?), okay, oh my. Um.	B-OO
G: Four times.	B-ATV
K: Oh god.	B-OO
A: None of this ever happens. (?). (?) thing	I-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
A: Put it in. Um. Banana, another banana, the yellow ball can go there. Okay	I-OO
K: Okay, that net, oh (?) put that up.	I-OO
G: Can I have our robot please? Thank you. I got it.	I-OO
A: Here, that’s all set, just put the fishes back to normal. Where’s Eve?	I-OO
K: Eve is over there, she’s (?). Georgie’s programming her.	I-OO
G: I'm coming, I had to program her so that she can get back to base.	B-ATO
A: She just did quite a bit destruction.	B-NSTO
G: What did she do?	B-OO
K: Yeah she did, she made (?).	B-NSTO
G: She made this flip over.	B-DO
K: And then she destroyed that,	I-DO
G: Okay	B-OO
K: She got this out and all of the fish.	B-DO
G: Er which one is it? Oh.  Oh yes.	B-QR
A: It was funny.	B-OO
G: It's programmed. Okay, okay.	I-OO
A: It still needs to go one more over.	B-DO
K: Okay, okay, oh okay.  Oh that, that, it's not working.	B-NSTO
T: It's just doing something different maybe then you had planned. That was amazing.	O
K: At least it got the corn out of the way and, okay.	B-DO
T: Yeah yeah yeah (?)	O
G: So I think it needs to go one more this way to be able to knock this down.	B-DO
A: That’s what I thought.	I-DO
G: Well lets try it again but lets move it over (?).	B-A
A: Where did the bacteria just go?	B-OO
T: (started) (?)	O
K: (?)	O
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
A: It's okay.	I-OO
20:00 G: Yeah it needs to go one more.	B-DO
T: Ooh you got all four pieces (of that).	O
A: ah ha	B-OO
G: Right I need to figure out how to get back to here.	B-A
K: Let me try something.	B-OO
G: Okay.	I-OO
T: (?) just come in and (?).	O
K: (So you decided to do that)	B-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Yeah goes... hang on, there.	I-OO
G: Okay so.	I-OO
A: Yeah	I-OO
K: Okay so what we can do is (?) to come back	B-A
A: It's all set back up so...	B-OO
G: We turn it around (?). It (?) things everytime.	B-ATO
A: That’s why we need a control thing, we need to figure out what we’re, for the (?).	I-ATO
G: We don’t have, we cant have it exactly on the edge, we have to have it closer so...	B-A
A: Hold on, can I go just play with it over there and try and find like the perfect spot?	I-A
K: Yeah sure, try.	B-OO
G: Hold on. We can work on this figuring it out (?).	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
G: Let me go and help (?).	I-OO
K: I think I can do that.	I-OO
A: One...	I-OO
G: Andi  I have an idea. So it doesn’t work exactly good if it's exactly on the edge, it works best...	B-A
A: So lets align the wheel with...here or do you wanna do half and half way?	I-A
G: Half way. Might be best.	I-A
A: So half way wheel and then the plough will go...	I-A
G: Two.	I-A
A: Two.	I-A
G: Okay ready?	B-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
Ast: This...	O
A: Okay. You have enough (?).	B-NSTO
G: Oh no it's (?).	I-NSTO
K: Okay.	B-OO
G: Okay it's (?) that’s good, so you didn’t break anything, wait a sec.	B-NSTO
A: Okay	B-OO
G: So let’s have this at one like that.	B-A
A: Okay now you gotta perfect it.	B-NSTO
T: That was good (?) knocked off four pieces of corn.	O
G: I like (?) okay so...	B-OO
A: I think we moved the baby fishy.	B-DO
K: ...maybe we can go like that.	B-OO
G: Okay lets try it so...	I-OO
K: (?).	O
G: (?)	O
A: Don’t we lose points if we hit the baby fishy...	B-OO
K: Is it down button?	B-QR
G: Yeah (?)	B-OO
A: Wait, let me see Eve again we have an issue.	I-OO
G: We’re downloading something.	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
Ast: Do you want me to show you a trick? A trick so you can see everything in one screen?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Yeah	I-OO
Ast: (Okay you figured it out).	O
G: (And then) the arrows.	B-QR
G: Oh sorry.	B-OO
A: That’s okay.	I-OO
G: So it can flip back up?	B-DO
A: Okay I think we should do...where did we go last time one?	B-A
G: One.	I-A
A: Lets try half.	I-A
G: Half? And let’s move it over a (tenth). (Right) a line here, see if that works.	I-A
A: Okay. Too much, too much.	B-DO
G: Look it. So because we added five up to here now (?). Okay ready? (?).	B-ATV
A: The fish, those are the only things we’re really concerned about. The ball and fish. Oh, oh, oh, oh... Eve we’re not...	B-A
G: That  didn’t work.	B-NSTO
A: Here can I try one more spot?	B-A
G: Okay. Excuse me that didn’t work exactly.	B-NSTO
K: Okay so what do you think, whether...	B-ATO
G: This one.	I-ATO
K: Hmm.	B-OO
G: We need to have it the other way.	B-ATO
K: Oh the other way?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Okay so maybe I can try that. Can you bring me Eve please?	I-OO
G: Not right now we’re busy.	I-OO
T: Do we get points for knocking carrots down?	O
G: I’ll see.	B-OO
DBF: How did you guys make that kind of plough thing for it?	O
A: Er just a lot of trial and error.	B-D
DBF: Oh cool.	O
A: And we kind of just (?) that worked.	B-D
DBF: Cool, oh so it's like a bunch of (?), I thought you had like a solid piece or something?	O
A: No we just connected some long pieces to make it.	B-D
K: No  (?).	B-OO
A: I'm gonna try three, three.	B-A
K: Oh no, no, no (?).	B-OO
A: Oh my god. Huh.	B-NSTO
K: Maybe that’s the problem.	B-OO
A: Okay, a few	I-OO
G: (?) something else to try while we’re fixing programing.	I-OO
K: Okay. Oh gosh. Should I download it?	I-OO
G: Yeah	I-OO
M: How’s it going over here?	O
A: Alright.	B-OO
M: (?) mission.	O
A: Um. Well we’re trying to do the ball.	B-OO
M: So you’re doing the (?).	O
A: We’re doing this fish.	B-OO
M: Yeah.	O
A: Um. And we’re trying to get corn in the ball.	B-OO
M: (?)	O
A: But we also keep hitting that.	B-OO
G: If you get it back to the base and then that probably counts.	I-OO
A: That’s really good.	I-OO
M: So I talked to one team before about trying to put a whole bunch of missions in one program, can you see why that might be a problem?	O
DBF: If one of them mess’s up then all of them suffers.	O
M: Right, right so you may wanna, you know one or two I think works if you start to do three, four, five then if you get tripped up somewhere along the way.	O
DBF: So you want to have it go back to the base so you can start a new one?	O
M: Yeah have it go back to base and then start a new (?) with a different name.	O
K: How do you guys get it to back up?	B-ATO
M: With a different name.	O
DBF: We just made it er. Go in reverse.	O
M: Yeah.	O
M: Yeah instead of like this (?). Like the default is (?) (?) negative fifty for like (?) I think maybe the (?).	O
K: Oh thanks.	B-OO
A: We need to work on programming	I-OO
G: I'm trying a different one.	I-OO
A: Trying, okay.	I-OO
G: Yeah. So...	I-OO
K: Here. Let me try to experiment.	I-OO
G: So if we do this.	I-OO
K: Can I experiment?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: See what it can do?	I-OO
G: Yeah	I-OO
K: Like like that?	I-OO
G: Yeah. Yeah.	I-OO
K: Oh focusing on, oh gosh.	B-NSTO
G: So we have it go backwards, four	B-ATV
K: Okay so...	B-OO
G: And then have it turn left?	B-ATO
K: Wait a minute, I think I can do something with this, I think I can do something with this, try it again, try it again.	B-A
A: Lets try like this?	I-A
K: Yeah try it again.	I-A
G: Okay can I see Eva please?	B-OO
A: Oh it's gonna hit the baby fish.	B-DO
K: Oh dangit. Try to, try (?) it not to do it  (?).	B-A
A: It's gone.	B-OO
