K: What we can do is (?). I need oh wait I’ll be right back. Georgie this has to be (?) we've got thirty minutes left	B-OO
G: No.	I-OO
K: Okay, okay.	I-OO
G: Well thank you we’ve thirty minutes left and you’re not even in here.	I-OO
K: I was thinking kind of... (?), okay, okay so, okay this kind of like that, I was thinking maybe we can just go straight...	B-A
G: This isn’t gonna work anyway. It’s not long enough. I can tell.	I-A
K: Go back right to the base all like, right through the	I-A
G: (?).	O
G: That worked so great.	B-NSTO
K: And then, okay, no wait, wait, wait, so that was our like original (?).	B-A
<laughing>	O
G: Thank you guys.	B-OO
K: God I'm never gonna finish this. Okay so.	I-OO
MT: So when, when you started it (?) right?	O
G: I try to yeah.	B-A
T: Taking a little break.	O
G: Again? Only thirty minutes left, trying this again.	B-OO
K: Okay so this, this (?). We can do... Here. What?	I-OO
A: Is yours on?	I-OO
K: Okay. Usually	I-OO
A: Did you ever turn back on your microphone?	I-OO
K: (?)  Okay. Instead of going straight, well we can go straight.	B-A
LBF: That kind of, sort of works.	O
G: That worked pretty well.	B-OO
K: (?) and on. So...	O
A: When we go straight? We’ll also (hit) this, knock over the ball it will hit this fish.	B-A
K: No, wait, maybe what we can do is if that doesn’t work then you could take it off. Cos it can go like this	I-A
A: But it will work.	I-A
K: We, we’re gonna stop right at the end of the (?), this will be a a left, go left and then...	I-A
A: Forward.	I-A
K: ...straight, yeah forward.	I-A
A: Then a right.	I-A
K: Then a right, backwards. And then we don’t even care about the fish.	I-A
A: Why don’t we hit it?	I-A
K: We’ll probably hit it anways. We don’t care about the fish, we will just go like this, once we go forward...	I-A
A: Right (?).	I-A
K: Go right like that. And then go backward.	I-A
A: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
K: Like right here and kind of hit like that.	B-A
A: And then hit the (?).	I-A
K: No not the (?), it’s way too much (?)	I-A
A: Just do what we have (?).	I-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: So hurry up.	I-OO
K: Just give (five).	I-OO
A: Because we’re almost	I-OO
LBT: Are you a (?)	O
G: No	B-OO
LBT: I thought you were	O
A: The problem is...	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: ...we’ve been saying almost this whole entire time.	I-OO
MT: So the first thing is that you have the ball and you put in there.	O
K: (?)	O
MT: This goes actually right in the hole. Okay. No p- p- I’m just asking	O
K: (?) stick onwards if you (?)	B-OO
A: I know	I-OO
T: (We ought) to find your team mates.	O
G: Thanks.	B-OO
K: So we can do that.	I-OO
T: What are you doing?	O
K: We’re making up a new um idea (?).	B-OO
T: Okay, so you guys were like taking a break from your work?	O
A: Yeah	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
T: I see.	O
K: Relaxation. Okay, okay Georgie we’ve got an idea.	B-A
G: Oh I already figured something out.	B-OO
K: Oh really.	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works?	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works.	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
K: It works.	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh can I see?	I-OO
K: Did it work more than twice.	I-OO
G: It worked more than twice. Not exactly how I wanted it but it still works.	I-OO
K: Georgie. Group hug. (Doing so good)	I-OO
A: Hold on (watch this).	I-OO
K: Yeah okay.	I-OO
A: Okay so I need.	I-OO
K: How old are you guys?	I-OO
GTS: Nine.	O
K: Oh. That’s cool.	B-OO
GTS: (?) seven.	O
K: Oh wow.	B-OO
A: That’s good if it works, it works.	I-OO
G: Yeah it works.	I-OO
A: Okay then we need to add a left turn after this if it works.	B-ATO
G: I'm not adding anything else.	I-ATO
A: That’s just gonna be it?	I-ATO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: We’re not doing the yellows?	B-A
G: No.	B-OO
K: What? We have to like...	I-OO
G: You don’t have to.	I-OO
K: (?) the mission book?	B-A
G: It says as many as you can, it doesn’t say you have to get both the yellow and the blue ball.	I-A
A: Well if we can, we...well if this works and we (?) perfected it. Then we can add more, but right now nothing is going on.	I-A
<general classroom noise>	O
T: So what’s the big arm thing?	O
G: It's going to push the thing and have it out.	B-A
T: Okay	O
G: And it's just gonna push the thing, it's just not long enough and I need to make it like able to push something.	B-A
T: Okay.	B-OO
A: Can I go and try it now?	I-OO
G: Hold on.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: I can’t believe that it works.	B-OO
K: I can see if I can do something else.	I-OO
A: No don’t touch it, because if it works then we don’t want to touch a single thing.	I-OO
G: Wonder if this will work.	B-D
K: Okay lets try this.	B-OO
G: This isn’t staying up, I need something else in it.	B-D
A: Oh, I got it.	I-D
K: Wow yours is not Eve. Theirs is not Eve.	B-OO
T: Yeah.	O
G: There we go, now it doesn’t bend.	B-D
K: Ours, Eve is basically like going through the path of destruction.	B-OO
G: Here I have an idea.	B-D
K: Exactly. Yeah.	B-OO
40:00 G: There we go.	B-D
A: Do you want a connection piece or	I-D
G: No this will work.	I-D
A: Wait is it high enough?	I-D
G: I think so yeah.	I-D
A: You should trust that...	I-D
((classroom chatter))	O
DBT: We'll be done in just a second.	O
((classroom chatter))	O
DBS: Okay all yours	O
G: Thank you	B-OO
A: So we’re here (?) Or (unless you did another) of differently or	B-A
G: That’s perfect	I-A
K: Wait, my gosh, where, where is this?	B-OO
K: Was this our claw?	B-D
G: Yes (?) Can you get me two little pieces that like the, block things?	I-D
K: Got it. They’re not big. They’ll, they’ll do.	I-D
G: Thank you.	B-OO
K: Let me do this.	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
K: Okay (?)	B-OO
A: Guys	I-OO
K: Yeah, what.	I-OO
M: This is just a ten minute warning.	O
K: Oh my god.	B-OO
A: We have nothing	I-OO
K: Oh no. No, no, no, no... This cant be happening.	I-OO
A: We have a robot...that isn’t programmed.	I-OO
G: It is programmed.	I-OO
A: I'm joking, I’m being dramatic.	I-OO
G: Ah	I-OO
K: It needs to be longer.	B-D
A: I can fix that,	B-OO
K: We can fix this.	I-OO
K: Let me go again, let me try it again.	I-OO
PR: Can I take a picture of your construction?	O
K: Sure.	B-OO
G: We (?) oh here we go.	I-OO
A: Hold on I can fix it.	I-OO
K: Yeah you can make that longer. More force, we need more force.	B-ATV
A: You go like that...	B-OO
K: Force force force force force force force	I-OO
A: Let’s try this. I need another one.	B-D
G: No we’re good, this is as long as we shall get.	I-D
A: Just put it back one.	I-D
K: It needs more force.	B-ATV
PR: Let me just take a photo before you start it off okay.	O
G: Hmm, hmm.	B-OO
A: Is that outside the...	B-A
PR: Let me take a photo.	O
A: No I just got to put this in there, so it...	B-D
G: Okay. I got it.	B-OO
A: You have to start it on the other way, it wont go through or even just, like that...	I-OO
A: Oh, oh. Oh no, no, no, no...	B-NSTO
K: We’re not working on the fish.	B-A
A: We can’t hit this one.	I-A
K: Yeah but it's not a fish.	I-A
G: Will it take points off if we hit it? If we’re not doing that one?	I-A
K: What, what if, what if we’re not working on the fish.	I-A
PR: Well then you shouldn’t touch the fish, right if you touch something you’re not working on you get (?). If they move the fish when they’re not trying to move the fish does it count against them.	O
M: Only if they move the baby fish.	O
A: Okay, okay. Lets take the points off.	B-A
K: Uh so close, more force. I got this, we need more speed.	B-DO
G: We need more speed for this.	I-DO
K: Okay, speed, speed, speed is this, is six alright?	B-ATV
<singing>	O
K: Is six alright?	B-ATV
G: What?	B-OO
K: Is six alright?	B-ATV
G: Six? Sure I guess.	I-ATV
K: No let me try seven I wanted this to be extremely fast.	I-ATV
A: Do what you gotta do. Here let me put that back on there.	B-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: No we shouldn’t have that.	I-OO
K: Program it, program it.	I-OO
G: It works better without it.	B-D
K: We're about to program	B-OO
A: But it looks cool.	I-OO
K: Come on we can do this.	I-OO
A: Well we can focus it on the end. Woh...	I-OO
K: Woah that’s awesome.	I-OO
GTS: What happened? What, what went wrong?	O
GTP: I don’t know.	O
<general classroom chatter>	O
K: Does it need to get back to base?	B-A
GTS: No, we no (?).	O
M: (?) bacteria you have to go back to base so, but it’s worth it to do that. Cos you got a lot done and you (?)	O
No big deal.	O
G: No (does zero have to go back to home base again?)	B-A
M: Or you call time (?) and leave it there.	O
G: Alright.	B-OO
M: That’s the other option.	I-OO
GS: We actually are trying to get it to the corn so...	O
M: So if you’re still trying to do another mission then you can’t call time and you’d want to pull it back to base because it's worth it.  It's worth the (?).	O
GS: (?)	O
M: Looks like that combine harvester is the problem.	O
G: We should get points for knocking out the thing right? Okay.	B-A
M: A model that’s been run over.	O
K: Hm mm mm. Eve...	B-OO
MT: Nobody knows how that happened.	O
A: (Sure) It's all good.	B-OO
K: Come on we have to go back...urgghh.	B-DO
A: Wait why wont it go?	B-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: Because it's going the wrong way.	B-DO
M: That’s a really long attachment I didn’t notice that the whole thing fits in base.	O
<sound of clapping>	O
G: (?)	O
A: Yeah when you push it it won’t go.	B-DO
K: It will go but not...	I-DO
DBT: It has to go that way.	O
K: Do like that.	B-OO
K: No we don’t have the (?) we can’t do this in ten minutes. Wait I think we can.	I-OO
A: Wait it's supposed to go that way.	B-A
DBT: Yeah.	O
M: Does your arm need to be that long for any reason? Could you use (?).	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
: I mean you’d need to change your program possibly but it's (?) I don’t know if functionally there is a reason for your arm being that long.	O
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Yeah we were trying to knock over the blue ball but also hit the arm	B-A
M: Yeah.	O
G: Without...	B-OO
M: Just drive closer to it?	O
A: No.	B-OO
M: No, I don’t know I just thought it would make it easier to fit in it base so... (?) Ah there you go.	O
G: That works.	B-NSTO
K: I'm programming it in order for it to turn like around in a circle.	B-OO
A: Looks like we gotta go do the thing we didn’t wanna but we have to do it. Where it has to go around.	B-A
G: Hmm.	B-OO
A: That’s what... We have a little bit of time I guess.	I-OO
M: It didn’t fall down that time. Woo it did.	O
K: I'm changing it, I'm changing it...	B-OO
G: Go ahead	I-OO
K: I'm changing it don’t worry, I got this.	I-OO
A: Ooohhh.	I-OO
G: Thank you.	I-OO
K: I'm getting this, I'm getting there, I'm kind of using my idea.	I-OO
A: We have fifteen minutes.	I-OO
K: Oh my god that can’t be...	I-OO
A: We don’t have time for this.	I-OO
K: We, we had to have time. We can do this, I know we can.	I-OO
Okay. Georgie work on the arm.	B-D
G: What (if w do) this? What if we do this? Where we have it leaning up against each other and then when it runs into something it falls over and then when it backs up.	I-D
K: Okay I'm gonna try something.	B-OO
G: It’ll be attached.	B-D
A: Try it I mean.	B-OO
K: Plug it in and see how it works.	I-OO
A: Hold on, trial, hold on we got a trial and error.	I-OO
M: Two more minutes	O
K: What? No we can’t do that, it cant happen. (?) mad at you now.	B-OO
G: yes	I-OO
K: Try it again, try it again, try it again.	I-OO
50:00 A: Fix the fish in the ball.	I-OO
K: Okay go...	I-OO
A: This is supposed to be there.	B-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: With that stupid fish. Why do you...I need more towards me.	B-A
K: Okay. And then um it’ll still be like.	B-OO
G: Here we go, ready? Lets try this.	B-A
A: It's gonna hit the baby fish. Maybe that’s what we want, maybe we want it to hit the baby fish and just take the points.	I-A
G: Here move it over a little bit. (?) quickly	I-A
A: (?)	O
G: Reset it. Ready?	B-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
G: Yeah we need to hit the baby fish for it to work.	B-A
A: Oh...	B-OO
G: Wait, lets try this one more time.	I-OO
K: Please try it because then I would have, I like to have another (?)	I-OO
G: It worked.	I-OO
K: It worked Please don’t, don’t, don’t,	B-NSTO
A: You got this. Go go go.	B-OO
K: Eve, Eve, Eve.	I-OO
A: I see why...it's try an- You see this thing, put it like this because last time it grabbed it and pulled it.  Put them all back.	I-OO
K: There it, it's not that hard to just pull the lever.	I-OO
A: When you’re using a robot it is.	I-OO
K: If all the other robots can do it you can do it to. Even though you are um a robot made for destruction. Don’t (?)...	I-OO
A: There we go.	B-NSTO
K: Yeah but that’s the baby fish. We can’t do the baby fish.	B-A
A: Well how much are the points, now if it's not that bad...	I-A
G: I’ll give up points just so we can do that.	I-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: It works we’re good.	B-NSTO
K: I killed the baby fish.	B-A
A: It's okay (?).	B-OO
G: So this is down like this right and this was angled up slightly and that was angled up like that. How much time do we have like thirty seconds.	B-A
M: Well I told everybody to take there last turn, did you have a turn?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: No.	I-OO
G: Then yeah, well let them finish.	I-OO
A: I think we’re done.	I-OO
M: You think you’re done?	O
K: (Why have they got blue) (?)	B-OO
K: So er. Careful your thing’s caught	I-OO
G: It works.	I-OO
T: So how are we looking?	O
A: Okay.	B-OO
G: It was great.	I-OO
T: Yeah? (?) good?	O
A: Here can you put this in (?)	B-OO
K: Like how much, points do w lose	I-OO
A: Er pretty cool.	B-D
G: It looks cool but it will block the arm from working.	I-D
A: Oh it will? Ohhhh, we’re not ready.	I-D
