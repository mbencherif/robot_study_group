K: Maybe we can work something with timer.	B-QS
T: When did you lose it just,	O
G: Just now.	B-OO
K: What did you lose?	I-OO
T: Did you go anywhere besides right here?	O
G: Oh go-	B-OO
K: What did you lose?	I-OO
G: My rubber band.	I-OO
T: Is this for your braces?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: (?) (color) sensor.	B-QS
K: Okay, yeah. I'm gonna try something. I really like touchscreens. Okay.	B-OO
G: That’s fine.	I-OO
T: Yeah.	O
G: I wear it all the time, some days (?).	B-OO
K: (?). Okay so we can get this out of the way, what do we do with this? How do you do like this? How do you delete a program? Okay.  Maybe I can try to make a program that instead of just doing it and then one rotation and then program and then one rotation, I can just like...	B-ATV
G: I already programmed that one.	B-OO
A: Hmm.	I-OO
K: (But how did you) program?	B-QS
A: We want to get the corn we want to, to get that thing.	B-A
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: So...	I-OO
G: I'm gonna push this in a little bit if you don’t mind.	B-D
A: Yeah and I'm just like, trying to like turn it over	I-D
G: (?) for a few minutes.	B-OO
A: Mm::: One second, I think I got it, nope.  I just gotta (?).	B-D
K: No, what’s going on, just trying...	B-QS
A: Oh I think I got it. Okay.	B-D
G: I'm hungry. What time is it? Only ten minutes.	B-OO
A: ‘til food?	I-OO
G: ‘til food.	I-OO
K: Oops sorry.	I-OO
G: I need to take that for a second after.	I-OO
K: Somebody hold this.	I-OO
G: It's not plugged in.	B-QS
K: Oh.	B-OO
G: Because I was about to take it and test it.	I-OO
A: I'm still working on the plough.	B-D
K: We don’t need anymore rotation for this.	B-ATV
G: No I'm trying to see like if it goes faster then it will go past the... Found my rubber band.	I-ATV
K: On the. Okay.	B-OO
A: Okay I think I have an idea	I-OO
G: (?) for a few minutes.	I-OO
A: Okay. I think I figured out once it's gonna do	B-D
G: Wait a minute.	B-OO
A: I figured it out.	B-D
G: What’s the fish one?	B-A
K: You take one and put it on the table and put it to base.	I-A
G: Wait a minute the fish one...wait if you bring...	I-A
A: Where’s those, oh...	B-D
G: If you bring the fish back to the base you get points.	B-A
A: Oh can I see the robot thingy me jigger, I think I figured it out. I probably didn’t.	B-D
G: Because I'm thinking if we remove the fish first I can program the fish one and I can set that one after and I, we can program that and then after we remove the fish back to the base then we can go get the blue germ one without touching the fish.  What do you think? (?) I have an idea. Can I show you my idea?	B-A
A: Hold on I think I got it.	B-D
G: Cool.	B-OO
A: Oh I did I found it, I found it.	B-D
G: We should put this...	I-D
A: Yeah that’s what I'm doing.	I-D
G: Can I take this out?, or, do you need that?	I-D
20:00 A: They’re just gonna go like that then like that and then	I-D
I’ll fix the whatever and now the thing is I got to figure out, I think if I take all of these are right, right?  That can go, can these go through here?	I-D
G: Well I was thinking for this one. We could like. Um we could have it go over, we could have it move forward, grab the fish back up and then go forward and knock the thing off.	B-A
T: Okay. So the other teams doing that fish, they’re gonna try to get the fish back to base, that’s what they’re doing.	O
G: That’s what we’re doing.	B-OO
T: Are you doing the fish?	O
G: We’re gonna try the fish one...	B-A
T: Yeah.	O
G: ...and then we’re going to try and knock the...	B-A
T: Yeah that one you’ll have to be careful because it says that the baby fish has to (?).	O
G: Yeah	B-OO
T: Yeah	O
G: So, I have an idea lets take a smaller one of this, I use two (?) take this one.	B-D
A: They don’t fit.	I-D
G: We’ll probably take the (?)...	I-D
A: If we go like that.	I-D
G: If we go like that you’ll still have room for this...	I-D
K: Hmm.	B-OO
G: ...and we don’t make this too big.	B-D
K: We’re using the plough and if (?) we can take all the fish.	I-D
A: Okay. See if we can just do those two.	I-D
G: But how do we put this on?	I-D
A: These?	I-D
G: We don’t need this.	I-D
A: Oh.	I-D
G: We could just have this as a plough.	I-D
A: (?).	O
G: (I’m just saying.) We don’t have to have this but whatever you think’s best.	B-D
T: You can choose any fish you want.	O
G: Okay?	B-OO
A: Okay, I'm just gonna try and do some things I guess. (?)	I-OO
K: Possibly this one? If it's further away from the (?).	B-A
G: (?) not doing anything (?) I'm gonna start programing something else.	B-OO
K: Wait if we can go like this we can take off the thing which...and then, and then we can go straight forward and go like this...	B-A
G: What is this? This is what I've been looking for this whole entire time, whatever, whatever.	B-D
K: Yeah, yeah, Georgie I need you for something.	B-OO
G: I'm busy right now, hold on.	I-OO
K: I still don’t know if this is like a microphone or not.	I-OO
G: Can I plug this in and then test something?	I-OO
A: Hmm, hmm I figured it out.	B-D
K: Meagan I need you for something really quickly.	B-OO
G: Hold on...what?	I-OO
K: You’re the master programmer, okay so you know how we’re gonna go like this and take this off the map?	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Okay, so what you can do is, like we’re also doing the fish right?	B-A
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: What we can do is, we can go like this, take this ba- um ball out, kind of go around this and get this fish and put it to base.	B-A
G: I was thinking either that or we do this, our thing starts here, it comes over here gets this fish brings it back goes, knocks this off the thing, comes back...	I-A
K: Yeah but that might be too much time, but that might be too much time, hmm, hmm that might be too much time because we can like go like this and like l::: an do::: and then while, if we wanna go, we can just go like that...and get this um out of the way.	I-A
G: But we have to bring the fish back to here.	I-A
K: Yeah it, it, it will (?) and while that, when we go we can probably take this and push this,	I-A
G: Okay	B-OO
K: So while, when we go we can take one piece of corn, go back to the base, hit the fish and put it back. Yeah.	B-A
G: I don’t think we’ll be able to accomplish all that.	I-A
K: Oh	B-OO
G: By the I (?). Yeah. I think our priority should be these.	B-A
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: So we’ll start by getting this one.	B-A
T: (?) knock both of them down (in the mission)	O
G: Yes.	B-OO
T:  So you have to make it	O
K: But we can do the fish, we can do the fish, the same thing the same time as we can do the map, the ball.	B-A
G: Oh okay, perfect so	I-A
A: And it flips up so when we don’t want it.	B-D
G: But I need to program this (?).	B-OO
K: (?)	O
A: I got it.	B-OO
G: I’ll try to (?).	I-OO
T: I like this.	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: We need to, oh what if it...well we need to kind of retract this.	B-D
A: Yeah it can go up when we don’t want it.	I-D
K: How do you, how did you program them?	B-QS
A: No when it goes back to base you can flip it.	B-D
K: Oh okay, I see where you’re going.	I-D
T: (?)	O
A: Thanks.  After three minutes of just trying to figure it out.	B-D
T: It came out very nice.	O
A: And of course Georgie helped me figure (something out).	B-OO
T: (?) and you’re doing the pollution reversal?	O
K: The, we take yeah and then the fish.	B-A
T: Okay so four points each, each part.	O
K: It will be eight points and then the fish, I don’t think we have to put it back though.	B-A
A: Is there, I think there’s a way where I can make this even simpler.	B-D
K: (Megan can I)...(because it's programing it...)	B-OO
A: I don’t think I need to join these.	B-D
K: You know, now it's touch screen	B-OO
A: Yep. That’s what I need.	B-D
K: It's just easier for you like that.	B-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: I can’t make the program any bigger because it won’t let me attach this.	B-QS
<General classroom noise>	O
K: (?) like that, just, (move) it over there. Hmm (interesting) oh that part. No, turn around and go like that.	B-QS
G: It's not working.	I-QS
K: Okay try it to see what we have to do (?).	I-QS
A: Hold on, hold on. And you can lift it but it just...	B-OO
K: Hmm. What should I work with? I kind of feel like the odd one out.	I-OO
A: Well that was odd. I have another plough idea.	B-D
A: Do we have one of them gold thingies no okay.	I-D
G: Okay. I need you to hold this up in the air, wait no I need this on the ground like this, just wonder how far this is gonna go, here we go.	B-OO
FAst: Girls we’re gonne break for lunch in five minutes.	O
G: Okay thank you.	B-OO
K: Okay. Yeah this needs, we need to focus this on the ground, are you done running it?	I-OO
G: Not yet I'm testing something.	I-OO
K: (?) it's somewhere in here.	I-OO
G: Move forward okay, oh I forgot to download it.	B-ATO
K: Okay.	B-OO
T: So we’re breaking for lunch in a couple of minutes.	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: Yeah.	I-OO
G: We know.	I-OO
T: Okay.	I-OO
A: Okay now look the plough is even simpler.	B-D
K: Yeah we got this.	B-OO
A: Because simpler the better.	B-D
K: That’s true.	B-OO
MA: Do you mind if we take a peek at the batteries to see how much time you have left on the battery, nine hours, that’s great, lets me see yours?	O
G: Hold on	B-OO
MA: That’s five hours worth, thank you.	O
G: Okay.	B-OO
A: How does that look now?	B-D
G: Cool, I think (?).	B-OO
K: I'm testing it with you.	I-OO
G: Let’s see if this works. Wait	I-OO
A: Oh my gosh I swear if that plough...here, hold on I got it. Do you want to take the thing off?	B-DO
K: I wanna, I wanna, I want to do this (?).	B-OO
A: Go, there go, do it, do it. You stupid plough.	I-OO
K: Yeah.	B-P
G: That didn’t work, so lets try this again.	B-NSTO
A: Oops.	I-NSTO
G: One, two, three okay so that didn’t work, so we need it four rotations that way.	B-ATO
A: So... We need one up on this,	B-D
G: Let’s see so we’re going to need...	B-ATV
K: Excuse me.	B-OO
30:00 G: Four rotations.	B-ATV
K: We got to do something about that plough.	B-D
F: Turn around.	B-ATO
A: Fixing it.	B-D
G: Move forward, four rotations...turn right we need forward, forward three rotations lets try that.	B-ATV
A: Plough will be fixed in one minute.	B-D
K: Ready? Can I do it? Oh...	B-OO
A: I need the robot again.	I-OO
K: Okay so we got one	I-OO
G: Ball over.	B-DO
K: It got some fish out of the way but the, but the baby fish is gone, that’s good.	I-DO
G: So we don’t necessarily wanna focus on the fishing one right now then.	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
G: So...	I-OO
A: Oh I want to see that.	I-OO
G: Yeah. (?).	I-OO
K: Okay try it, try it again.	I-OO
G: Oh oops.	B-NSTO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: Oh that (?)	B-NSTO
K: That didn’t work, oh that (?) fell, we got a mission.	I-NSTO
G: Mission accomplished	I-NSTO
A: Yeah.	B-OO
G: So, lets see...	I-OO
K: No it's like this...	I-OO
A: Now a  wheel’s gone on that axle.	B-A
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: Try it again it used to work.	I-OO
G: Well it takes four rotations to get there.	B-ATV
A: Like back a little, go back.	B-A
K: Go back and then try it again.	B-OO
A: Oh	B-NSTO
K: You hit the fish. Guys. We need something to do about that.	B-DO
A: It's gonna run it over.	I-DO
G: Yeah that’s kind of the point right now, it runs it over.	B-A
K: You got this.	B-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha	I-OO
K: The baby fish is intact.	B-DO
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: We need to do something about...	I-OO
G: So it comes down here and then it turns, so we need it to turn all the way...	B-DO
K: Ah ha. I got that	B-OO
G: ...like this and then go forward.	B-DO
K: So.	B-OO
A: I need the robot to work on the plough so other side.	B-D
K: Um you can get that and turn it into.	B-QS
M: Okay first up that we think we’re almost absolutely positive we have enough battery power in the mics for the rest of the day, so leave your mics on, don’t worry about your mic, just leave it on don’t worry about it (?).	O
K: Is that good?	B-QS
G: (?) no do four.	B-ATV
M: (?) go outside and enjoy lunch now, lunch is here	O
G: (?)	O
M: Also during lunch break you come back have a full afternoon to (?) challenges okay.  Let’s get a bite to eat (?).	O
K: Where is it?	B-OO
G: Okay lets go get food.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
A: Hold on I wanna finish this plough first.	I-OO
G: It's lunch break.	I-OO
LUNCH BREAK	O
A: I fixed the plow!	B-D
K: Let me just stick this in.	I-D
G: Okay.	B-OO
K: Hopefully you’ll (?).	I-OO
G: Let’s take it off though	B-D
A: Yeah I turned it on?	B-QR
K: That is (?).	B-OO
G: Oh yeah okay did you download?	B-QS
A: Yeah, it will work with the plough.	B-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: Start it back now before because we have a plough now.	B-A
G: Third.	I-A
A: Sure, third with plough. Do we want the plough on or...	I-A
G: Plough on.	B-D
A: Let’s try with it on.	I-D
G: Maybe we should go like this (?). If we had enough friction it could put down.	I-D
K: Let’s try this.	B-OO
A: Wait we’re doing third right there. huh huh ha ha ha. It really likes to...likes to make a mess.	B-A
G: Let’s re-program that.	B-OO
K: It's going straight.	B-ATO
K: Can you move out the way please so I can. You program this?	B-OO
T: You guys (?) microphone’s back on.	O
K: Yeah	B-OO
G: We never took them off.	I-OO
T: Okay.	O
G: Excuse me.	B-OO
K: Oh sorry I wanted to program but okay.	I-OO
G: Let’s see the forward, forward, turn around then...	B-ATO
A: How is this gonna work?	B-A
K: Well it's kind of like let me show you come on something I wanna show you. So what I, what we do is we can like put it like this and then we (?) like push it like that	I-A
