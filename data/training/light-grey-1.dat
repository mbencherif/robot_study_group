A: So come to me	B-OO
K: Er straight move. Straight move or curved move?	B-ATO
A: Do straight. The one.	I-ATO
K: One?	B-OO
A: Sure	I-OO
K: Oh that’s backwards	B-DO
A: Yeah that’s	I-DO
K: Okay stop. Let’s do two. Stop.	B-QR
A: That’s the right way it’s just, you have it backwards.	B-DO
K: Oh. Okay. Okay.	B-OO
A: Then it comes back.	B-DO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
A: Go back	B-DO
K: Let me try this again.	B-OO
T: Cool.	I-OO
A: Oh	I-OO
K: Alright. Let’s try one see what happens.	B-QR
A: Can we unplug this for now?	I-QR
K: Yeah I think we can.	I-QR
G: No. I’m programming it. I haven't programmed it yet.	B-OO
K: (Oh can I have a go at programming)	I-OO
G: I huh uh	I-OO
A: She’s just doing the thing	I-OO
K: I have an idea maybe I should work on a plough	B-D
A: Plough. We should use this.	I-D
K: Should we wanna start with,	B-OO
G: (?)	O
K: (?)	O
A: Okay let’s just check this thing. No.	B-A
G: We wanna start with um.	B-OO
K: I don’t really wanna start with the bacteria because it’s a bit too tricky	B-A
G: E: um. Pushing the balls off that one.	I-A
K: The ba- ba-	B-OO
A: Yeah let's try that.	I-OO
G: Um I think we should use something like this. See this.	B-D
K: Hm mm	B-OO
G: And we can	I-OO
A: I was thinking we could just make our plough like this and just keep adding more and more	B-D
G: Go ahead and do whatever you guys think I’m gonna go look at the table and then I’m gonna (start) (?) programming	B-OO
K: She’s the programmer we’re the builders. Okay.	I-OO
A: I’ll try and make a plough.	I-OO
K: We (need to make a) (?) like this or this	B-D
A: Oh let’s try this. These.	I-D
K: Okay I have a feeling maybe we can like go like this, and this can go like that	I-D
A: The problem is attaching them.	I-D
G: And I’m adding a sensor	I-D
A: Hold on let me try.	B-OO
K: (To add a sensor we need a sensor). It would be really awesome if we could do it by um the voice commands.	B-D
A: Uh th- th- that’s not gonna happen.	B-OO
K: We can probably make it happen.	B-D
G: Where’s the sensor?	I-D
A: Not in the time we have.	B-OO
G: It’s not over here.	B-D
G: Where’s the sensor?	I-D
K: The the sensor is that.	I-D
G: I found it.	I-D
K: Oh shall I put it in?	I-D
G: No I got it.	I-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
G: So which way do we want it to go do we want it forward. Mostly? If we do then we need. Okay can I have one of those cords.	B-QR
K: L- let’s get the short one.	B-D
G: Okay so attach.	I-D
A: I’m gonna be making a plough by the way,	I-D
G: This	I-D
K: Okay start making a plough I’m gonna work on maybe a claw?	I-D
A: Go ahead. I have a plough idea.	I-D
G: A what?	B-OO
K: A claw	B-D
G: Okay you try and make that I don’t know how you’re gonna do that but okay.	B-OO
K: Can I have a pegolian?	B-D
A: I don’t know what that is but okay	B-OO
K: Pegolian is the blue pegs. Thank you.	B-D
A: There so. I’ll just keep building like this. To make a plough.	I-D
K: Okay this is actually um I think I know what I’m doing. Look. This will be the handle. (You) (?) (should test). Like if it can go straight.	I-D
G: We will test. Just right now we're not gonna program.	B-A
T: Schedule for today, so we’ve got...	O
K: Oh oh	B-OO
T: ... lunch twelve to twelve thirty and then team building	I-OO
K: Miss Palmer is this a good um crane. Idea.	B-D
T: It looks pretty cool	O
G: But how will we get it to move, that’s the only thing.	B-QR
A: We’ll figure it out.	B-OO
T: Did you decide what mission you wanna do?	O
G: We first wanted to do I think we should do	B-OO
A: Everything.	I-OO
G: Push the balls off (?)	B-A
K: Yeah	B-OO
T: Okay	I-OO
G: That sort of thing.	I-OO
T: (?)	O
G: We’re making a plough we’re also adding a sensor, so it can sense it and then lightly push it off without destroying anything else.	B-A
T: Okay	O
G: So I need	B-D
A: So it can fastly  get over there but then lightly push it off	B-A
K: And I’m making um er like a crane to (gather) like the I dunno the corn. Possibly.	B-D
A: We’ll just hit the thing so the corn comes off. We can also probably push it. Cos hold on. Let me go check something out cos I think we can just push it. We can just push it.	B-A
G: .hh huh (we can just push it.) (?)	I-A
A: So this is like a plough I guess.	B-D
K: Er	B-OO
A: Then we’ll like fix it (around)	B-D
K: Yeah that’s that’s that’s good	I-D
G: ...this is going in A?	I-D
?: (?) place, drop fully showing the low red temperatures(?).	O
A: I am super good at programming.	B-OO
?: Which one is that that’s the	O
A: (?)	B-OO
?: That’s the one	O
G: (?)	B-OO
K: Mm	I-OO
?: Er	O
K: Yeah you are	B-OO
? Um (?)	O
A: Okay.	B-OO
K: I think I have a piece,	I-OO
T: (?)	O
K: Is gum allowed?	B-OO
A: Okay all you have to do is push it really.	B-A
G: (?)	O
K: I’ll ask her	B-OO
G: What do you think of the sensor that I made?	B-D
K: I, I have a question.	B-OO
A: I think it will work.	B-D
K: I have a question, is gum allowed?	B-OO
A: It’s awful. No I'm just kidding it's pretty good.	B-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: Are we gonna put another on the other side?	B-D
K: They say it is, they say it is. So I’ll go get some for all of us.	B-OO
G: So...	I-OO
K: I’ll be right back.	I-OO
A: Alright.	I-OO
T: Where are you going?	O
K: I get my, get some gum.	B-OO
T: Okay where’s (?) in your jacket?.	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: How many, I'm gonna see how many rotations it takes.	B-ATV
A: Oh this will rotate so...	B-D
G: To go one around.	B-ATV
A: Are we putting this in the front or the back?	B-D
G: The front.	I-D
A: Okay so I'm gonna need to look at that and figure...	I-D
G: Right.	B-OO
A: ...out I'm gonna...	B-D
G: Particularly on that back like that (?) you add some things like a hook.	I-D
A: Huh.	B-OO
G: To be able to do that when we pull the white trailer.	B-A
T: You got two, two. Do you want one Aurelie?	O
A: Oh sure. Thank you.	B-OO
T: Yeah	O
A: Oh,  I am (?). Because this is all gonna be changed in the front.	B-D
K: I didn’t know if you wanted gum or not	B-OO
A: Thank you.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: What flavor is it?	I-OO
K: Orange.	I-OO
A: This is difficult. Building a plough. (?)	B-D
K: Okay so I'm making the other...I'm (?) pretty much (?)	I-D
G: (?)	O
G: Base and how much one rot- how far one rotation will give us.	B-ATV
A: Okay.	B-OO
G: Well lets see...	I-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
K: (Excuse me)	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
A: They’re not having the thing I'm looking for.	B-D
K: What are you looking for?	I-D
A: I know it when I see it.	I-D
K: Yeah.	B-OO
A: We’re gonna end up having for the claw we’re gonna have to have something with gears.	B-D
G: There we go.	B-OO
A: So I was thinking something like this.	B-D
G: Okay I'm gonna see how much longer rotation will take us on the (base).	B-ATV
A: Okay, alright.	B-OO
K: Okay	I-OO
A: Gonna end up having to do a lot more than I wanted.	B-D
K: Oh well.	B-OO
A: No I mean just a lot more things on it.	B-D
K: Hmm.	B-OO
A: Want it to be more simple but I cant (?) wanna take the whole thing apart.	B-D
K: I don’t think you.	B-OO
A: Exactly.	I-OO
K: That works.	B-D
A: At last.	I-D
G: Great.	B-NSTO
K: Did it fall?	B-DO
G: It didn’t move.	I-DO
K: Oh. Hey can I try something on that, can I try something please? Can I try something?	B-OO
G: It's not moving forward.	B-DO
A: Yeah it will.	I-DO
G: How did we do that before?	B-QS
A: We clicked forward and it went.	B-QR
K: Here let me try. Can I?	B-OO
A: Go ahead.	I-OO
K: Can I?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Wait, what? oh I'm programing (on) this.	I-OO
K: Oh my god.	I-OO
A: Because we figured out another way to make it move forward.	B-ATO
A: Come on I need this thing.	B-D
K: We need the car to be more stable.	I-D
G: It moved backwards?	B-DO
K: It moved forwards.	I-DO
G: Oh that’s forwards, so I have an idea.	I-DO
A: Oh I got it, I got it, I got it, that’s much better, no that’s not better at all, oh hold on, hold on.	B-D
G: Hey go ahead and do what you’re doing. (?).	B-OO
K: What do you want?	I-OO
G: S- wait I have gum, I aren’t supposed to have gum.	I-OO
K: Oh your braces.	I-OO
G: But I'm chewing it anyway, because I'm hungry.	I-OO
A: Oh it needs to be a bit more stable. Of course hold on, hold on I've got it, I figured out how to program (?) like a plough.	B-D
K: Not as stable as I hoped but good enough.	I-D
A: Go, go, go. There you go. I made a plough, I just got to attach it, which I'm going to do right now.	I-D
G: Okay so...	B-OO
A: Hold on.	I-OO
G: Hmm.	I-OO
K: I made a sort of plough.	B-D
G: (?)	O
A: (And it) works huh huh huh	B-D
K: Can this work?	I-D
G: (?)	O
K: It's like a picker upper thing.	B-D
G: We can do that, oh there’s one for groceries, do we have to lift it onto the table, how do we do that? Wait a minute...	B-A
K: .hhhh	B-OO
G: (?)	O
K: I'm trying to figure something out.	B-OO
A: Wait, did you guys figure something out?	I-OO
K: I'm figuring something out.	I-OO
G: Are you going to (clap)?	B-D
A: Almost I just troubleshooted something.	I-D
K: And I, it's not exactly a claw but it's kind of like it.	I-D
G: I need to test something.	B-OO
A: Can you give me a minute?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Because I just figured out how to make this plough.	B-D
K: We gotta make sure that the plough is retractable.	I-D
A: Oh darn.	B-OO
G: What do you mean retractable	B-D
K: Well it can go up and back, it's kind of like a, let me show you.	I-D
A: Okay, well that’s your plough so far, I'm gonna you know make it like more ploughy but.	I-D
K: It's kind of like this, it can like push it and maybe like when, while we’re and then it can go like...	B-A
A: It's over...there.	I-A
K: Yeah like that, can I, can I do something (?) program?	B-OO
G: Hold on we’re testing one rotation.	B-ATV
K: Oh my god.	B-OO
G: Just to see how far it’ll go, that’s, that’s one more rotation.	B-ATV
K: That’s one, one rotation.	I-ATV
G: And that’s the program.	B-DO
K: That’s, that’s a little bit too far.	I-DO
A: If we can have it, turn	B-ATO
K: No one rotation’s right there,	B-ATV
A: From over here...	B-A
G: Yeah I know I’m in the	I-A
A: (Don’t.)	B-OO
G: So one rotation will take us to here from...	B-ATV
K: Oh okay, okay I get it okay so let’s try this.	B-OO
G: so (?) right here.	B-DO
K: Okay lets try, lets try.	B-OO
G: Here.	B-A
K: One rotation.	B-ATV
A: Then for this all we need...	B-A
K: No (?).	B-OO
G: (?)	I-OO
A: No it's not supposed to go there, oh no.	B-DO
K: (It fell) Here I know where it goes.	B-D
A: Wait where did that chord come from? Oh it's supposed to be like that.	I-D
K: I kind of made like a little tiny plough in like.	I-D
A: Where was that?	I-D
10:00 G: One two	B-ATV
A: (Three)	I-ATV
G: (That wasn’t it).	B-DO
K: (?)	O
G: (That’s too far).	B-DO
A: Yeah that’s too far.	I-DO
A: So one base takes us to this intersection.	B-ATV
G: Two, three.	I-ATV
A: Three.	I-ATV
G: The fish, the fish.	B-A
K: Yeah we can do it like that.	I-A
G: Four.	B-ATV
K: It's on the mat. We got to do something about it, maybe we can like (?).	B-DO
K: (Here) (?) program a bit?	B-OO
A: Here can I see the (?).	I-OO
G: I just want to just finish this one and download it and then you can do a different project one.	I-OO
K: Huh, huh.	I-OO
G: Don’t touch it yet please,	I-OO
A: Who	I-OO
G: I wanna make sure we get the one onto this one.	I-OO
K: Oh my (cord)	I-OO
G: Guys we don’t want to add anything to the side because it will make it too long.	B-D
K: Oh yeah that’s right.	B-OO
A: I'm not going past the tire hopefully.	B-D
K: Okay. No you’re not you’re fine.	I-D
T: So this is like the top of it you guys have built?	O
A: Yeah we’re building it.	B-D
K: Oh.	B-OO
A: I have an idea.	B-D
K: We need it to go faster.	B-ATV
G: I can’t make it go faster.	I-ATV
T: (You can) there is a programming thing for speed	O
K: One day you can h-, oh my gosh.	B-OO
G: (?) I think that’s what. What is (?).	O
K: Oh yeah, yeah there’s a clock thing right there (?).	B-QS
G: (?) that’s power. Hold on what does this say?	I-QS
K: (Maybe) more power equals more speed.	B-ATV
T: Okay so this is number of rotations, so if you want it to go a certain distance you can count rotations.	O
A: Oh, not having what I want.	B-D
G: Okay let’s...	B-OO
T: What is this, try this one, what does it say?	O
G: Oh my gosh it's a touch screen.	B-OO
A: What?	I-OO
T: That’s cool.	O
G: It turns it and...	B-ATO
T: So that’s the turning okay, so that changes direction, so maybe this is...	O
K: Yeah boom, we got this.	B-OO
T: (?) like if you change that number the eighty seven does that make it go slower?	O
G: Yeah.	B-OO
K: Just try it, try it.	I-OO
A: Come back here.	B-DO
K: Yeah.	B-OO
T: Is that slower?	O
K: That speed right there.	B-ATV
T: Okay.	O
K: What if these (?) all these different places.	B-QS
G: Medium motor, large motor, motor settings stuff like that.	I-QS
T: Okay. Alright	O
K: Georgie. Maybe we can download voice, voice control.	B-ATO
A: Oh, oh, oh come here oh come here.	B-OO
K: Okay can I, can I work on this for a minute.	I-OO
G: As soon as I download it on here.	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: Well the only thing is we can’t (?) I don’t think we need this actually.	B-D
K: Why don’t we need the sensors?	I-D
G: Because it just adds too much like to the sides.	I-D
K: Okay.	B-OO
A: We could change where the sensors position is? Yeah I think it could go right here.	B-D
K: Maybe you know like in the front and...	I-D
A: Goes on...	I-D
K: Why am I so uncomfortable wearing these microphones they’re huge.	B-OO
A: Oh my god I forgot I have one, thanks for reminding me.	I-OO
K: Georgie can I start programming?	I-OO
G: Yeah.	I-OO
K: I really want to use touchscreen.	I-OO
A: Okay um thanks for reminding me.	I-OO
K: What haven’t we what haven’t we been working on?	I-OO
A: Everything.	I-OO
K: No what haven’t we been working on? Oh no, no didn’t really do that.	I-OO
A: Sensor can stay away, I'm still building a plough.	B-D
K: Thish, wait... mm:::: Project. Hold this for me? Hold it for me please? Please?	B-OO
K: (Color) sensor, touch sensor, temperature sensor.	B-QS
G: Did anyone see a miniature rubber band anywhere?	B-OO
A: Nope?	I-OO
T: Is this like for you hair?	O
G: No.	B-OO
T: Was it part of the kit?	O
G: No.	B-OO
T: Oh it was part of that	O
G: No	B-OO
T: Oh what colour is it?	O
G: Tan.	B-OO
