S: Okay what do you want me to draw, where do you want me to put it?	B-OO
L: We don’t have that, which one are you doing?	I-OO
F: Number two.	I-OO
L: Number two	I-OO
S: Neither one.	I-OO
F: Number two.	I-OO
L: Well you don’t have to yet.	I-OO
S: Okay so number two. Er two,	I-OO
L: Lets see which ones (a four) (?)	I-OO
F: I think it's over about two and then it... yeah	B-A
L: Yeah I'm just wondering about Sarah’s map, Sarah are you calling this like what corner, what corner (?).	I-A
S: Okay, base corner, other stuff that doesn’t matter corners.	I-A
L: Sarah my question is, is this so, are you saying that, are you saying that’s like this?	I-A
F: Okay I think it's (two)	I-A
S: Okay whatever way you look at the base thing that’s how it's gonna be.	I-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Wherever you...	I-OO
L: It goes like this then?	B-A
S: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay so I think it's... um	B-A
S: I can drop the (?).	I-A
F: Oh Lyn you can make it degrees for the turns.	B-QS
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just a second.	I-OO
L: What’s that one?	I-OO
S: What do you think it is?	I-OO
L: Don’t know.	I-OO
F: Sarah do you mind if I...	I-OO
L: (?) snake.	I-OO
F: ...do you mind if I change the turns to ninety degrees	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: So it's just more exact? I didn’t realise you could do that.	B-ATV
S: No my corn snake is (this). That’s most of the snake Lyn, it's chiseled, look at its chiseled abs.	B-OO
L: Okay so I think that works like this, it's two down and two in so I think it's right here.	B-A
F: Alright cool.	B-OO
S: So about right here?	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Be right there actually.	B-A
F: So Lyn I changed all the turns to ninety degrees just so it would be consistent (?)...	B-ATV
S: Exact?	B-OO
F: ...change it by the degree rather than by the rotation, I think that makes a little more sense.	B-ATV
L: Alright, yeah that looks right Sarah.	B-OO
S: Okay, so that’s for number two.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Nap time.	I-OO
L: If you want to take a break you can always go outside.	I-OO
S: No I don’t want to take a break I'm just being weird.	I-OO
F: If you wanna like sit down for a second it's fine.	I-OO
S: You realise I am sitting right?	I-OO
F: No I mean like while, if we’re testing out stuff you don’t have to walk back and forth if you don’t want to.	I-OO
S: I’ll be fine I'm not that weak.	I-OO
F: No it's fine, it's like...	I-OO
S: Oh, she’s copying my notch mat.	I-OO
F: How dare you...artistic licence.	I-OO
S: They’re not even Lyn.	I-OO
L: Sarah doesn’t matter, no Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah stop.	I-OO
S: Sorry (?) picky, a control freak when it comes to maps.	I-OO
L: Alright (?).	I-OO
F: We could work on the Banbury Cheese (?).	I-OO
L: Yeah Sarah you could always work on the banner right now instead.	I-OO
S: Fine.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Plus I don’t want to draw the cheese.	I-OO
L: Did you program (it Fiona)?	I-OO
F: Okay, ah I did the next turn, um, let’s actually just try it on the ground.	I-OO
L: Okay did you save it?	I-OO
F: No it's still plugged in here, I’ll, I’ll save it and just try it on the ground, but I want to add another thing before...	B-ATO
S: No it’ll be like this...it’ll be like this.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Put that frog down.	I-OO
T: What you doing another one?	O
F: What? Lyn	B-OO
L: What	I-OO
S: (?) making a map.	I-OO
F: Why is this going wrong the ninety degree turns aren’t working, watch what it does, it's going like, the first one works, no but it doesn’t, alright lets change it back to revolution.	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: It's like a turtle, if you flip it over on it's back it doesn’t do (anything) alright lets change it, that would have been cool though but...	B-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright. And the number of rotations...	B-ATV
L: I think actually I have to go outside for a minute.	B-OO
F: That’s fine.	I-OO
L: Cos I’m getting a very bad headache. Mama are you coming?	I-OO
T: I’d love to come  (?)	O
F: Sure I, I think I need to breathe a little bit.	B-OO
T: (?) little (break). (?) tic tac	O
F: Oh a tic tac.	B-OO
<microphones off while team takes a break>	O
F: Okay, oh okay.	B-OO
F: Okay so we’ve got that turn.	B-ATO
L: Do you want to check number one save what we have now...	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: I feel like it's not really super consistent.	B-DO
L: Okay, it looks like it...	B-OO
S: Fiona we’re not about consistency here, we’re about dumb luck.	I-OO
F: Ha ha ha	I-OO
S: And consistency.	I-OO
L: Okay we also have a map now (?), so okay lets bring the map for number one.	B-A
S: Where’s my mappy map? Oh there it is.	B-OO
L: Okay	I-OO
<General classroom noise>	O
F: I don’t think that... Er we asked about the rats thing too but on this one there aren’t any rats.	B-OO
F: Oh thanks.	I-OO
L: Oh Sarah can I see the map?	I-OO
S: Which one are we testing?	I-OO
F: One.	I-OO
L: Are we saying this?	I-OO
F: Oh lets...	I-OO
S: It's lined up with the words base.	B-A
L: Okay so that one.	I-A
F: And this one is gonna go (?).	B-DO
S: Oh right, backwards.	I-DO
L: (?) backwards.	I-DO
F: This one’s short, it’s almost done probably.	B-QR
L: Okay. Whoops.	B-NSTO
S: It just caught barely on the edge.	B-DO
F: Okay, okay.	B-NSTO
L: Okay lets try that again.	B-OO
S: Wait (grab) (these two).	I-OO
F: It would be cool to do this with like a really long time to work on it, alright lets make it parallel to the word base.	B-A
L: Well that didn’t work.	B-NSTO
F: No but it was closer, like if we lined it up with, if we line the edge of the napkin up with these tick marks and made it like this.	B-A
L: Like that okay. Oh that thing. Yeah that did not work.	B-NSTO
S: It's, it's (?).	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think those things are interfering a bit. Huh	B-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: Trying to figure out original line up.	B-A
Y: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Like that?	B-A
L: (?) start it?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: No it needs to be farther back.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Like so.	B-A
F: Yeah, so line up with the corner	I-A
L: Okay wait. No, farther back? Is that what’s wrong?	B-DO
F: Maybe it was like here, maybe it was...	B-A
L: What about like that?	I-A
F: No, that messed it up.	B-NSTO
S: Sorry Lyn.	B-OO
F: I think it was more like that, like it was lined up like that. No.	B-A
L: No. Here?	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Except we can’t remember how we lined it up. That works.	B-A
F: No it doesn’t.	B-NSTO
S: Oh come on.	I-NSTO
L: Okay well now we know it has to be more in that direction okay you guys can...	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Oh what’s this? I think this thing broke.	I-OO
S: I can’t believe you guys got eyes and we didn’t.	I-OO
L: We have eyes. Yeah, Sarah we have eyes.	I-OO
F: But we’re not using them Sarah so we don’t need them.	I-OO
S: Well you guys look (?) bulldozing (?) we look like a square.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: I think we have like another hour for this, so we’re not in a super big rush or anything.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Sarah, stop dripping things.	I-OO
S: Where’s our other map?	I-OO
L: It's right there.	I-OO
S: Did we leave the map somewhere?	I-OO
L: No Sarah it's right here.	I-OO
F: Can you hold on to this?	I-OO
S: Okay. Oh you wrote it on the back of my evil genius list.	I-OO
L: Yeah, (what’s the evil genius list?).	I-OO
F: Ha ha .hhh	I-OO
S: We got bored at one moment it was (a laugh)	I-OO
F: It's a long story.	I-OO
S: It was a desperation measure.	I-OO
F: Oh (?).	I-OO
<microphones off during cookie break>	O
F: Alright, lets	B-OO
L: I think it was supposed to be like here, because that’s what it was at before	B-A
F: Like (windup). (?) here alright	I-A
L: Okay	B-OO

S: Okay which, which ones were they?	B-A
F: Erm	B-OO
S: Which one’s were they lined up between?	B-A
F: We’re not gonna move a robot we just wanna look at where it was lined up a little bit, oh...	I-A
LGS: No it killed the baby fish.	O
F: You’re just watching it murder helpless animals.	B-OO
L: So	B-OO
F: I think it was lined up.	B-A
L: (?).	B-OO
F: Oh this one?	B-A
L: No I think it was, okay, one, two, three...right can you put it down (this way)	I-A
F: (And) this one. I think.	I-A
L: Okay seven on this side Sarah you can just write it down, so seven on the right and...	I-A
F: Like three on the left.	I-A

L: Well it comes back correctly.	B-DO
F: Yeah but it doesn’t do anything. (Okay)	B-NSTO
L: That’s a good sign.	B-OO
C: Can I actually (?) about seven inches.Yeah (that’s gonna be good).	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
C: Lets do, lets do the whole thing like two more inches that way.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
C: Wait perfect.	O

DBT: WOOOOOO	O
L: Lets try it again.	B-OO
S: Yeah, yeah, yeah.	I-OO
F: No.	I-OO
S: See if it works again. If it actually worked...	I-OO
F: Victory.	B-NSTO
S: Victory by default.	I-NSTO
LGS: That was awesome.	O
F: Worked so well <laughs>	B-NSTO
L: One, two, one two three, four, five, six, seven.	B-A
F: And that one’s lined up with the E.	I-A
L: One two three four five six seven. Are you sure?	I-A
F: I think it was more like...	I-A
L: They’d know it was (?).	I-A
F: It was covering the V.	I-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: No according to this photo...	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
