A: They’re cleaning it up.	B-OO
K: I know.	I-OO
A: Yeah, Eve would do that.	I-OO
K: Eve would do that.	I-OO
A: Maybe.	I-OO
K: Oh it's broken, what did I do? Oh my gosh. This is...	I-OO
A: Thank you.	I-OO
K: Miss (?) where were you?	I-OO
T: I was (?). How did you get on?	O
K: Well Eve is, Eve is the step of world domination.	B-OO
A: It's okay, don’t worry.	I-OO
G: It was an accident.	I-OO
K: It was all her fault.	I-OO
A: I did the same thing.	I-OO
K: Eve is the one, I just noticed something, Eve is the one who spread ebola.	I-OO
G: Is there an Eve in this (?).	I-OO
A: Got to program everything all over again. Maybe we should scratch all our programming and start	B-A
G: Yeah trying something else.	B-OO
A: Okay now if we don’t get somewhere in like the next thirteen minutes.	I-OO
G: I've scratched it and then done it three times.	I-OO
A: Oh my god. Hey you better work, because we’re counting on you. Okay, okay.	I-OO
G: Wait, don’t touch it.	I-OO
K: I wasn’t touching it. I have an idea, we should bring our computer, wait no never mind.	B-A
G: It's working.	B-NSTO
A: No the cow, the cow, the cow.	I-NSTO
G: It came down this way then I need to angle.	B-DO
K: Hey.	B-OO
A: We figured out what happened.	B-DO
K: Georgie,	B-OO
A: Here,	I-OO
K: Georgie we should dele-, oh we should scratch all (?)	I-OO
A: No right there	I-OO
K: We should no, we should scratch the ones that we’re not using	I-OO
G: Okay, this, this one. That one we’re using just in case.	I-OO
K: Do you know what we’re doing wrong, here let me upload this.	I-OO
G: What are you doing?	I-OO
K: I'm, I'm, I'm putting this up on the computer.	I-OO
G: Because I figured out what we need to do.	I-OO
K: Hmm, hmm, what, what’s that?	I-OO
G: You’ll see.	I-OO
K: Where’s my phone?	I-OO
A: Whoever’s listening to this, goodbye, I'm turning you off again.	I-OO
K: Ha ha	I-OO
G: Why are you turning it off?	I-OO
K: No she’s not.	I-OO
A: Ha ha ha ha (joke’s on you). I was gonna turn it off.	I-OO
K: We’re friends right? Are we friends?	I-OO
G: No.	I-OO
A: No (seriously are we friends now).	I-OO
K: He doesn’t hear you Georgie or she. I just call, okay your name is Oliver, your name is Oliver. Hi Oliver.	I-OO
A: Everything’s all set up.	I-OO
K: I name the person who is listening me right now (?) his name’s Oliver. Hi Oliver how are you?	I-OO
A: Oh can I press it. I think it should be more that way.	B-A
K: Press it just press it.	B-OO
G: It was fine, here.	I-OO
A: Yes.	I-OO
K: Oh no, no it wasn’t,	I-OO
T: (?) baby fish	O
G: We weren’t going for the fish anyway, we were going for the ball and we’re not worrying about the fish.	B-A
A: It's going. No...	B-NSTO
K: You spread Ebola again.	B-OO
G: Why do you guys keep picking it up?	I-OO
A: It hit the thing, it was gonna go hi-...	B-DO
TM: Lets push this table back a little bit, there we go.	O
G: It may have hit but it doesn’t mean it's not working, it may just be stuck for a second. Don’t touch it	B-OO
A: See...	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: Why is it like to the straight...	B-DO
G: Oh wait no leave it like that because then we have all these points	B-OO
A: Yee hah.	I-OO
<laughing>	O
K: Oh my gosh what is wrong, no we just learnt the creative way of getting...	B-OO
G:  (?).	O
K: ...all the virus we just (?) points.	B-OO
T: Cool	O
G: Let’s try this again.	B-OO
J: Yeah lets just...	I-OO
G: We have to make sure, we have to perfect the angle again. What are you doing?	B-A
K: I'm taping it.	B-OO
G: Okay so it has the... It was angled like right here.	B-A
A: Yeah	B-OO
A: Turn, turn.	B-DO
K: Oh my god Eve.	B-NSTO
<laughing>	O
K: Oh god (?).	B-NSTO
G: That doesn’t work.	I-NSTO
A: Ha ha ha	B-OO
G: It worked the first time.	B-NSTO
A: It's really like close (enough).	I-NSTO
G: Like this? No, I'm gonna position it because (?).	B-A
A: Like at this point we shouldn’t even care.	B-OO
K: Yeah but it's a competition.	I-OO
A: I didn’t come here to compete. Woooh  Evil, evil,	I-OO
G: Stop touching it, you keep moving the stuff, you keep picking it up, hey is this your phone?	I-OO
K: Yeah. Eve you didn’t try to steal it did you?	I-OO
A: Knowing that stupid thing it...	I-OO
G: Or did she? Or did she?	I-OO
A: Okay, okay Eve there you go, go, go, go.	B-NSTO
K: Can I try to program it?	B-OO
G: It worked, it worked so good.	B-NSTO
K: Hey let me try to program it?	B-OO
G: But we had programmed it. It worked, it worked we got a lot of points and then it didn’t work.	B-DO
A: It knocked the whole entire thing over.	I-DO
DGT: Where did you start it?	O
DGS: Here, here.	O
DGT: That’s (?) that’s why because that’s not (?) did it last time right? It's gotta be, each time you bring it back to base.	O
G: Where’s our angler?	B-A
K: It’s okay here’s our angler so.	I-A
G: We can angle it (?) next time	I-A
A: Right let me see the program, I wanna try and tweak it.	B-OO
K: Yeah you can help me tweak it, because, okay so I need to see what happens... So here’s what I'm trying	I-OO
A: Sorry.	I-OO
40:00 K: We, we can go straight like, like that and then like  we’re keeping the front and back.	B-ATO
A: So it goes forward. It comes backward.	I-ATO
K: Forward, backward and then instead we can go like a bit in front and then like no, wait a minute.	I-ATO
A: Don’t tweak anything past here.	I-ATO
K: Yeah. We move right. Ha ha, I think this is gonna work like that and then we...	I-ATO
A: We need Eve.	B-OO
G: Perfect ha ha	I-OO
A: We need Eve. I'm gonna go get Eve. We need her.	I-OO
K: Now I need this to be straight.	B-ATO
A: Give me the port.	B-OO
K: I'm taking it. Okay, see how it is so far, see how it is so far.	I-OO
A: Probably just messed the whole thing up.	I-OO
G: That’s the cow we accidently destroyed.	I-OO
K: Are you saying that (?).	I-OO
A: No I'm just saying that I'm (done with) this.	I-OO
G: We killed a cow. We knocked its head off.	I-OO
A: Is it good?	I-OO
G: Lets see you have a point here, you have a point there, you have four points there.	I-OO
A: I'm pressing it.	I-OO
K: Yeah, okay, press it. Okay try it, try it.	I-OO
DGT: Which program are you running right now?	O
DGS: (?).	O
DHT: That’s not the first (?) that you had, try the first one that you had.	O
K: Can we have Eve back please?	B-OO
T: (?) it's another virus.	O
A: Eve is ready to be tested one more.	B-OO
DGT: (?) you started it at lego and then it came a little and then it (?).	O
K: And then I’ll see what I can do next?	B-OO
<classroom chatter>	O
DGS: That one?	O
DGT: Yeah because then you can have it going straight right? Right lets (?).	O
A: Try it, it has been tweaked. All of ours is destructive.	B-OO
G: Press that...	I-OO
A: What are you doing? Restart...	B-NSTO
G: Lets try this again.	B-OO
K: How is it working?	I-OO
A: Awful. Oh it's slowly going backwards oh I see.	B-ATO
T: It's slowly going backwards.	O
K: Oh I see!	B-OO
G: What did you guys do to it?	I-OO
A: I didn’t, she did, I got it.	I-OO
K: Hey.	I-OO
A: Hey we all make mistakes.	I-OO
G: Where...	I-OO
K: So...	I-OO
A: Here I got it.	I-OO
G: It's right here, needs to go faster.	B-ATV
A: We had like a road map of what it like looked like. You are a naughty robot.	B-A
A: Wait, can we have some paper and a pen?	B-OO
YT: What?	O
A: Is it all set?	B-OO
K: Can we have some paper and a pen?	I-OO
YT: A pen?	O
K: I need a paper and a pen.	B-OO
A: Where’s our jig?	B-A
K: Oh okay. Aha thanks.	B-OO
G: No.	I-OO
A: That’s not right angle, (fix) all them fishes.	B-A
G: Proper grammar please?	B-OO
A: Close enough. Hey. Mm mm. Mm mm. You’re bad, you’re very bad.	B-NSTO
G: I'm just gonna do a whole other program.	B-OO
K: Oh paper, paper, paper.	I-OO
A: No I think we can,	I-OO
G: So we want it to move forward, how many five? Then after five we want it to reverse.	B-ATV
K: Okay so how is this gonna go? The base is right here right? There’s one right here, one right here. Wait I'm looking at the map, oh I'm sorry about that.	B-ATO
G: Then we want this to move to, that way.	I-ATO
A: So are we starting again.	B-OO
G: Yeah. Do a u-turn.	B-ATO
A: Whoever is listening, I am so sorry you have to listen to me for four hours.	B-OO
G: Me too.	I-OO
A: Like you must have an awful job, that or they’re just paying you a lot of money and you decided to do it.	I-OO
G: And then I need it right turn ...and then one, two, three, four, five. And then a slight left turn. And then...forward and then have to go straight, right turn...	B-ATO
K: Look this is a really rough scale of what we’re going through.	B-A
A: Ha, ha, ha, ha.	B-OO
K: What we’re going to do (it) (?). Hey guys.	I-OO
G: What?	I-OO
K: Okay so this is basically a really rough map, so maybe we can use this to help us program.	B-A
G: And then backwards.	B-ATO
A: That’s done.	B-OO
G: Done.	I-OO
A: Oh program it. Eve, Eve, Eve.	I-OO
K: Guys map.	I-OO
A: Lets go. And we have an idea of what we’re doing. I guess.	I-OO
K: Oh, yes...	I-OO
<laughing>	O
A: I swear if Eve can do that one more time.	B-NSTO
T: This is cool.	O
K: Oh gosh. Okay.	B-OO
YT: Now then need to program it to get back to the base and then...that’s pretty good	O
T: That’s pretty awesome.	O
A: No, we got to keep trying because she’s unpredictable.	B-DO
K: Yeah she’s definitely very unpredictable	I-DO
K: Oh okay.	B-OO
A: Oh I see why, hold on I see why.  You remember how like last time it just ran over the fish?	B-DO
G: Yeah.	B-OO
A: It needs more that way.	B-DO
K: That’s genius.	B-OO
G: Oops.	I-OO
A: Eve, bad girl.	I-OO
K: Okay the person that’s listening to him, I don’t know if it's a girl or boy so I'm just naming him Oliver.	I-OO
T: Oliver.	O
K: Hi Oliver.	B-OO
A: We really need to perfect (the early)	B-A
K: Okay,	B-OO
A: Here try it right...	I-OO
K: Are you having a lot of fun ta- when we’re talking about Eve’s evil deeds.	I-OO
K: Maybe we should go.	B-A
G: We need more force. I got this.	B-DO
K: Yeah we got this, we got this.	B-OO
A: Hang on.  For the first one...	I-OO
K: Yeah we’re (gateway)	I-OO
A: First one	I-OO
K: Okay.	I-OO
G: All the way up.	I-OO
A: I'm dreading this.	I-OO
K: So (the way that we’re supposed to do it is). Okay.	I-OO
A: Go.	I-OO
G: I think we just need to figure out um...	B-A
A: This is gonna be a lot of force, just saying.	B-ATV
K: Yeah.	B-OO
G: Ready?  (?)	I-OO
K: Go.	I-OO
A: I’m prepared to hit it. It's taking (?).	B-A
K: Oh my god it almost did.	B-NSTO
G: Restart.	B-OO
A: Restart everything, someone go over there and do that.	I-OO
K: It almost took the fish to the base, we almost got a point.	B-A
A: Are you ready?	B-OO
G: Ready?	I-OO
A: You’d better do this right.	I-OO
G: Set, go.	I-OO
K: Better angle?	B-A
G: Reset.	B-OO
K: Do it with different angle.	B-A
G: Ready, set...	B-OO
A : (?).	O
G: Stop touching it.	B-OO
A: I thought we were still perfecting this.	I-OO
K: Hurry, hurry, get your fingers out. Okay, we need to angle it a bit more here, kind of like here.	B-A
A: Hold on. Can I see the robot thingy for a second, I think I figured out a good angle. You keep trouble shooting. Go like this, start it, lego so the ball’s on lego. Okay so what are you doing? Start back here.	I-A
K: Come on. That missed it.	B-DO
A: Here someone wants to test.	B-OO
K: Yeah.	I-OO
A: Why don’t we just like get rid of it.	I-OO
K: You sat on my seat,	I-OO
A: No	I-OO
50:00 K: Idiot. I don’t like you anymore.	I-OO
A: I hate you.	I-OO
K: Hey juveniles.	I-OO
G: (?) stop fighting.	I-OO
T: (?) good drawings.	O
K: This is kind of a rough map, so it will help us kind of program.	B-A
T: Like when you come back here you can figure out like (?).	O
K: Yeah.	B-OO
T: It should be going backwards here, should be going forwards here.	O
K: Yeah. Like for instance this is...	B-OO
A: Eve. Eve right here.	O
K: That’s a beautiful picture of Eve. Just saying. She, what we have to do is we have to program her at full speed, kind of like go here so the ball would kind of knock off somewhere.	B-A
T: Hmm.	B-OO
K: And the fish, one fish will be like closer here so...Eve can also on her path of destruction	B-A
T: Hm mm	O
K: Can go over here and like knock it out.	B-A
T: Hmm, hmm.	O
K: What I'm hoping is that the fish can go back with her to almost the base, so we might take the backwards route a bit farther.  She can go forward again and then right, get that...	B-A
T: I thought she knocked all of the things down that one time, like...	O
K: Maybe we can push the forward...	B-A
T: Did she go at an angle?	O
K: No. It possibly did, maybe we should push the forward part a bit longer. I'm tired, I'm talking (?).	B-A
A: (?)	O
K: ((singing))	O
A: This is frustrating.	B-OO
G: Yeah tell me about it. Oh my god.	I-OO
A: Hey you, you can go outside and take a break for a minute.	I-OO
K: Again.	I-OO
G: I am finishing this. Yes. So now all I need to do is get the (?).	I-OO
A: She’s plugged in when you’re ready to download.	I-OO
G: So, what do I need here? So I'm just gonna have her back up as far as she can.	B-ATO
A: Eve why do you have to be so, just uh...	B-OO
G: Okay lets try it.	I-OO
A: Download.	I-OO
G: Downloaded	I-OO
A: Okay.	I-OO
G: Oops (?)	I-OO
A: Here I’ll start working on (?).	I-OO
DBF: (?).	O
DBS: That works, come on.	O
DBA: Well now we know it has to be more in that direction	O
G: Let’s see if this works.	B-OO
DBA: I can’t believe you guys got eyes and we didn’t	O
