C: And that’s all I’m gonna explain right now you can mess around try some different things and er we can always check back (?) explain some other things later.	O
F: Do you wanna try some stuff Sarah?	B-OO
T: Hm do you guys know what you wanna go for?	O
S: Okay	B-OO
F: Um	I-OO
T: (?) rats	O
F: Oh	B-OO
T: And rats get big (?)	O
L: (Pet) (?)	B-OO
T: There’s a rat hidden somewhere and you have to find them and then bring them back to base.	O
F: Ooh!	B-OO
L: Where do you think they are do you think they can be in there like	B-A
T: You have to know where they are.	O
F: Er we can’t program the robot to look for rats	B-A
T: Ha ha use your rat sensor.	O
F: Ha huh huh.	B-OO
T: Bee bee beep bee bee bee beep	O
F: Rat detected.	B-OO
T: Detected (?)	O
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
L: Well	I-OO
F: Do you wanna just read some of the things Sarah or?	I-OO
L: What are we looking at	I-OO
F: We’re looking for rats.	I-OO
S: Are those like (croissants)	I-OO
F: Like (old croisstants)	I-OO
S: Um (?) rat to be	I-OO
F: I don’t think we can touch anything.	I-OO
T: You must be able to touch. Oh there’s (?)	O
F: I like this thing it’s cool.	B-A
L: Um.	B-OO
T: I like the sink	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I wouldn’t push on	I-OO
F: Maybe there’s	I-OO
S: I think I’ll read over the projects.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah lets look at our different options.	B-A
S: Okay so. Ak. They have rolly things.	B-OO
F: Okay. Yes.	I-OO
S: Good	I-OO
F: So what do we have as good options.	I-OO
S: Okay pollution reversal. Corn harvest.	I-OO
F: No.	I-OO
S: Fishing. Pizza and ice cream. (?) fresh produce. (Distant) travel.	I-OO
L: Oh Sarah don’t just read the titles we need to like know	I-OO
S: Yeah but	I-OO
L: What you do for them.	I-OO
S: Okay.  I shall read pollution reversal. As first of many. No matter where pollution or (?) it usually finds it way to water and and of course all plants and  animals take in water. Since we depend on plants and animals for our food pollution is a source of contamination. Not just in what we breathe and drink. But also what we eat. Yellow and blue balls represent pesticides on farms and heavy metals in water. While on rings they are off the mat. Balls touching mat are worth four points each.	I-OO
F: Alright let’s underline the parts that are important. I bet we’re allowed to write I hope we're allowed to write on this.	B-A
L: Why don’t you guys think about that and I’ll keep on building.	I-A
F: Okay so.	B-OO
L: Does that sound good? I’ll take that as a yes. Okay.	I-OO
S: (?) us a plough.	B-D
F: Okay corn harvest. Okay	B-OO
S: Harvest. A harvester	I-OO
F: We don’t need to read the actual story. It’s going (?) about food.	I-OO
T: huh huh huh	O
L: We already learned about food we’re (cooking) people.	B-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
S: Okay (?) (fish). Fish can be frozen immediately after being caught	I-OO
T: (?) fish are worth three if the baby fish is still touching the (?) I think you might wanna be standing over here so that you can (?)	O
F: Yeah. Let’s look.	B-A
L: I (?) build stuff they’re going to. Uh it looks like we have more to make.	B-OO
F: Alright pizza and ice cream those ones are worth seven points	I-OO
L: (What it is yes)	I-OO
F: The pizza and ice cream yeah if you pick them up or push them	B-A
L: Yeah it is cos	B-OO
F: If they’re we could either have like a claw or even a machine could	B-A
L: Oh we don’t oh	B-OO
F: Pull some or a thing that pushes something too. That one shouldn’t be too hard I don’t think.	B-A
L: Oh we don’t get to get (?)	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: And then farm fresh produce so er to get the if you get the yellow truck in base it’s worth nine points	B-OO
S: Wait what is it?	I-OO
F: If you get the yellow truck into the base it’s worth nine points. Remember rule twenty three what does that mean	I-OO
T: I know what rule twenty three I’ll find out.	O
F: Yeah. Alright cooking time the white p- er the white pointer in the red zone is worth fourteen points so if we build a machine that can get it to go around into the red part then it’s worth er fourteen points so that coud be a cool one to do. If we could figure out how to do it.	B-A
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: We’d just need to make it like specifically go in a certain circle.	B-A
S: Which one was that?	I-A
F: This one	I-A
S: Okay. No (?) Um then we’ve got (?) mission groceries	I-A
F: Wait lets keep reading the ones on this page. We haven’t read all of them. Er we don’t need to like actually read about them. Er thermometer spindle click slash drop fully showing the low red temperature is worth twenty points.	B-OO
S: Mm	I-OO
F: Which on is that? That’s the thermometer thing? That’s a  lot of points. That’s cool. Er this one doesn’t exist. Next refrigerated ground transport. Blah blah blah blah blah. Er I know okay er the trailer in base is worth twelve points.	B-A
L: What do you do to it.	I-A
S: Well you probably have to hook it.	I-A
F: Er to get to move it into base	I-A
T: I know what rule twenty three is if you decide	O
F: Okay. Wh- what is rule twenty three.	B-OO
T: It means that	O
L: Oh don’t push on the (?)	B-OO
T: your vehicle	O
L: Okay there we go	B-OO
T: needs to be at the (east well) at the end of the minute it can’t like get to the wall and then leave. It needs to be there.	O
F: Wait where	B-A
T: On the ea- on that thing where it the robot touching the east wall	O
F: Oh the east wall okay. So it needs to be touch-	B-A
T: I don’t see any directions on here	O
F: Okay I see it here	B-A
S: East wall	I-A
F: It’s north south east west. Okay so.  Refrigerated ground transport er getting the trailer in the base is worth twelve points. Er the trailer with meat inside and no germs inside with any of its wheels I don’t think it has any meat I don’t think there is any meat	I-A
L: (Why’s this moving?)	B-OO
F: It has wheels I think	I-OO
S: Oh yeah	I-OO
L: Oh yeah okay	I-OO
F: Um alright. So if this thing was cool	B-A
L: Which one.	B-OO
F: Um. Empty dispensers are worth twelve points each if no so. And so Lyn emptying this out hey you’re stepping on my shoe.	I-OO
S: Oh. Ack!	I-OO
F: It’s okay. Er.	I-OO
S: I’m sorry.	I-OO
F: Those things emptied out are worth twelve points if we can get the bacteria all of the bacteria into the base. Each of them are worth twelve points or seven points if we don’t. So if we got all the bacteria out of those it would be twenty eight points.	B-A
L: Okay so that would probably be like the first one to go for.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: In like this one.	B-A
F: Yeah. Um	B-OO
00:00  <general classroom noise>	O
L: ...okay...so yeah we should probably do that one	B-A
F: alright	B-OO
L: The disinfect one...	B-A
S: Do you want to start programming that one?	B-OO
F: I think a cool one could also be figuring out how to make this turn around.	B-A
L: So we yeah lets start by working on those two.	B-OO
S: Wait, we could do that (?) (shovel) the (?)	B-A
F: Yeah, yeah. Yeah that’s what we were thinking of, but at least figuring how to dump them first.	I-A
S: Um okay so you circle round once then you (start) (?)  the plough to go in then you do the same as (?).	I-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: Those ones.	B-A
L: Okay, so...	B-OO
S: See what I mean?	B-A
F: Yeah	B-OO
T: Can you combine a couple of challenges to get more points like could you get	O
F: I think you can do multiple ones	B-A
T: You could get bacteria (?)	O
F: But there’s a time limit.	B-A
T: Right	O
A: And like she was saying be very careful about having too many missions	O
L: Right	B-OO
A: Because what if if something happens during the first one then the rest of them won’t work either so	O
F: Yeah. Okay	B-OO
A:  Work work with you know think about that too, I mean should you wanna have (?).	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
A: You  gotta (?) program (?).	O
T: Like a um (?) like at the beginning of (?) when they make toast (?)	O
F: (Revolver) machine?	B-OO
D: (Revolver device) right	O
F: I love that.	B-OO
T: (?)	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: We got to make those at, some of those at school one time, it was so cool.	I-OO
S: Okay, lets figure out how to do the...	B-A
L: Okay. Okay. Lets plug in	B-QR
F: Alright.	I-QR
<general classroom noise>	O
F: Oh (drat) Okay.	B-OO
<general classroom noise>	O
L: Right, so are you guys ready?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: So if we want to do the first bacteria one you have to go straight forward and then we have to turn to the left and then of course we have to back up and back up again.	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Back into base. Are we gonna try the plough then?	B-D
F: I'm not sure, I think that a good goal would just be to be able to knock them over at first since we don’t really know very much about the programing anyway. Um	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: But if we can make a plough that like pushes them back in that would be cool.	B-D
L: Alright well lets set it up now. Right. Fiona.	B-QS
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Are you doing (computering) this (program)	I-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: So you need moving forward, probably twice.	B-ATO
F: Alright so which one would that be?  large motor moves steering, large motor right?	B-QS
L: Yeah. Okay (Play it then). Okay.	B-OO
F: Can you do can we do...both of those?	B-QS
L: No I think there was a different one for that.	I-QS
F: Right.	B-OO
L: Maybe it was move tank probably. Yeah	B-ATO
F: Alright let’s figure out what this actually does, do you want to like put it on the floor or something?	B-OO
L: Sure	I-OO
F: See if, how it actually moves?	B-DO
L: Okay, so go ahead and play that?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure, okay so this is just the default setting, so it just goes forward.	B-DO
L: Okay, we should have that twice I think.	B-ATV
F: Yeah, I think that you can actually, you can make the rotations you can make it to have two rotations.	I-ATV
L: Okay lets try that.	B-OO
F: So...cool.	B-NSTO
L: Yeah okay and now we want to have one, so...this one I think?	B-ATO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yeah okay and we want that to be C I think. Ah	B-ATV
F: I didn’t mess everything up, crumbs.	B-OO
L: Okay, so go ahead, wait, okay go ahead. Yes.	B-NSTO
F: That’s cool, lets see if we can change it by changing the power,	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Like how much of a turn we can make it do, so it started off at fifty and now this is sixty two.	B-ATV
L: Okay, hold on Sarah	B-OO
S: Hm?	I-OO
L: Is there something that you want to do to help? Do you want to help Fiona with the programing?	I-OO
F: Yeah because it would be good for all of us to be doing stuff.	I-OO
S: Im trying to think of what we, how we’re circling around this.	B-A
: Alright,	O
S: So	B-OO
F: how about you look at the thing and like strategize about what we would do. That could be helpful.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: While we fiddle around with computery stuff.	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Hmm.	I-OO
L: Can we rotate it anymore?	B-ATV
S: Wait we’re doing bacteria one right?	B-A
L: Yeah the first (one).	I-A
F: Can we do one point five?	B-ATV
L: I think...	B-OO
F: Is that a point number?	B-ATV
L: This one, I do to um get (?)	B-OO
S: So it circling (?).	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Okay, I'm gonna set the power back down to default (?).	B-ATV
S: I'm not using it I'm just strategizing okay?	B-A
F: Okay I'm gonna write fifty and then...	B-ATV
S: Are you sure we need to move forward twice or only once?	I-ATV
F: No I...	B-OO
L: Think twice because...oh that’s good a little bit less.	B-ATV
S: Okay we can make the rotations, I think we can even do quarter revolutions, that’s pretty cool it seems like a valid number for it.	I-ATV
L: Yeah that’s perfect.	B-DO
F: That’s like turning perpendicularly	I-DO
L: Okay and now we need another one of these, I think this time only one of them.	B-ATO
F: Wait, what that’s moved steering (?).	I-ATO
S: Okay then you go forward and you move back to the base and you repeat it all.	I-ATO
F: Oh one of	B-OO
L: Wait no	I-OO
F: Yeah. There are different settings for the play thing where there’s like a loop thing, there’s a switch thing and there’s a loop (?). It’s kinda interesting	B-QS
L: (Fiona go ahead)	B-OO
F: Okay, er okay this is just with the tank thing at the regular.	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Setting.	I-OO
L: Can you do that again?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: You know (?).	I-OO
F: Shall I try it with one point five or something.	B-ATV
S: Okay you want it to do that but then you want it to turn around and move and back around.	B-ATO
L: Yeah we need to back as well, but...	I-ATO
F: Great	B-OO
S: Because of you reverse you’re just gonna scatter them you want them all to dump and then you wanna circle round and scrape them all up.	B-A
F: Alright so we can do one of these words like that, alright lets try this...	B-ATO
F: Okay we can change the direction.	I-ATO
L: Why did you turn that again (?).	I-ATO
F: I thought we were going to try to loop around it or something?	B-A
L: Well (?).	B-OO
S: No, no you wanna loop around, okay so um	B-A
F: Alright what have we already done, lets...	B-DO
S: This is the bacteria this is the truck. Okay starts here, it goes round this way. Okay bacteria (would be a bit smaller but,) then it hits the (handle). You want it to turn around this way to go here, move round the sides pick it up again and then go, because if you reverse it's just gonna scatter them everywhere pretty much.	B-A
F: Okay, so what’s the next step? We’ve already made. Sarah do you wanna watch what it does already? So that you can know what’s going on. So it already goes like that.	B-OO
S: Yeah and then you wanna turn it the C wheel again.	B-ATV
F: Okay.	B-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
F: No but that’s going to run into the lever because say (?).	B-A
S: Yeah but you want it to run into the lever.	I-A
L: No it's already (?).	B-OO
F: (?) Yeah. We want it to go off once.	B-A
L: Because see we push it like that and it moves and this all dumps but then it we continue to turn this (?) (in the lever)...see.	I-A
F: So you want it, wait, alright lets, lets see what we, lets just er...	I-A
L: So we have...	I-A
F: ...(?) it going?	I-A
L: Let’s say we start here that’s (in there, in there) (?). Okay and we all go.	I-A
F: And then we wanna have it make a full turn and sweep them up	I-A
L: Yeah, yeah...(?) seems right yeah?	B-OO
T: (?)	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
T: (?)	O
F: Ha ha	B-OO
L: Ooh	I-OO
F: Alright so right now we have the first part now we just want to make it turn fully right?	B-ATO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright so we want to make it have a full turn right?	B-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So I think we do that with this and have like one of it.	B-ATO
L: Wanna see what it does so far?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: Ignore the last part of it though.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: That would be with the C thing, but we’ll, we’ll make it do like (?)...	B-ATV
L: Mama. Wanna what it does?	B-OO
T: What what? Do I wanna see what it does?	O
L: Yeah. Okay, well (?)how far we can turn for this right.	B-ATO
F: Right	B-OO
F: That’s gonna turn all the way round  though.	B-ATO
T: (?) (the measurement) already?	O
F: Um we’re going to just try out the different motions and then tweak the measurements from there I think, just so we’re know what we’re going to do before we, I think we’ll be more like (?).	B-A
L: Hey er Sarah though can you watch this because I have to go to the bathroom.	B-OO
F: Right so can you sit in Lyn’s seat maybe and watch the robot thing?	I-OO
L: Okay (?).	I-OO
T: Okay honey don’t forget to leave that (?) I’m sorry sweetie.	O
S: So full circulation for the (last motion).	B-ATO
F: Yeah	B-OO
S: Yeah and then you move it forward and bring it back in,	B-ATO
F: Okay...do you want to try out what we have so far?	B-OO
S: Hmm?	I-OO
F: Do you wanna try out what we have so far on the thing?	I-OO
S: Okay. How (?) loaded onto (?)	B-QS
F: Um we have it plugged in so I think that we...(?).	I-QS
S: You already renamed it.	I-QS
F: I know but I'm gonna name it Banbury cheese underscore bacteria, alright now I'm gonna download it...I think it's downloaded, so there we go we have a new Banbury cheese so we could, er I think it's that one. And I think we can unplug it and still play this program. Alright, lets try it.	I-QS
S: (Fine)	B-OO
F: We’ll definitely have to change the measurements and everything but...	B-A
S: Okay, I say we start right here.	I-A
F: Alright.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: Okay it's too close.	B-DO
F: Alright.	B-OO
S: Hmm.	I-OO
F: We could have it go...no.	B-NSTO
S: Ach it (dams)	I-NSTO
