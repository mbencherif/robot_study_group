F: What? Yeah it's not a bad start but, alright...	B-NSTO
S: Hm. So we need to adjust it so that it will go out like this, turn and slam into that	B-DO
F: You can also start it at a specific place like where both of the outside tips over wheels or like touching.	B-A
S: Yeah remember it can’t be out.	I-A
F: Yeah, or like where when we look above it it's like that so, I think that, alright lets watch it again and see which part...whoops, alright, so it went like that, what are we doing...	I-A
S: Hmm, we could do a different process where it circles round like this, backs up and then scoops the bacteria around that?	I-A
F: Yeah alright, let’s have it	I-A
A: I'm just a little concerned  this is sloping a little bit. I’m gonna pull the table, (?) (make sure it doesn’t fall.)	O
S: Oh	B-OO
F: Alright	I-OO
T: Think about (?) never mind I’m not (going to say nothing)	O
F: I think you’re allowed to help us but just not give us an answer.	B-OO
T: Think what’s gonna happen when (you) dump it	O
F: It's going to go there, so we’re going to need to have it go back this way right. Because...	B-A
S: Lyn the robot’s too big	I-A
T: Ha ha ha ha ha ha	O
F: It's your fault, no it's fine, er we need to start it diagonally because if we start it this way it just runs into it and if we started it here it wouldn’t do that.	B-A
S: Well no, wait, wait, wait (Lyn), so say we like work on the (?) like adjust it so that instead of going (?) around like this it will go around like this, move around this one, go forward, back up and then go forward again.	B-ATO
F: I don’t think we need to do that.	B-A
L: Right can I see?	B-OO
F: We can have it go diagonally to, it doesn’t need to be going...	B-A
L: Okay can I see what it does?	B-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
F: We wouldn’t want to start it there because it just runs into that so we were starting it more like that. But then it just, it tries to spin all the way round so we don’t need it to spin all the way round so we should have it do like a little turn and then keep going maybe?	B-DO
L: Yeah. Uh	B-OO
F: We should have it (started) a specific measure.	B-A
L: Yeah I wanna see what happens (?). Okay then if we backed it up then it would probably work that don’t touch that one though.	I-A
F: That would yeah.	B-OO
S: Thank you pull it out, pull it out.	I-OO
F: Just touch the machine.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah. Wait don’t touch the lever...	I-OO
F: Ah okay, well (?).	I-OO
A: It broke off, it came off when we fixed it, let me fix the um (?) (it come off) (?) there we are.	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay so let’s okay	B-A
F: Did we start it like here yes?	I-A
T: So do you think (?) running into it is a problem?	O
F: No.	B-OO
L: No.	I-OO
T: It's a problem, if you break it it's not gonna be able to work.	O
F: No we’re not...	B-OO
L: That was the wrong, no, no, no.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah it works. After we pulled it out.	I-NSTO
L: Yeah it's a different (?).	B-A
S: (?)	B-OO
F: It’d be cool if there was a thing where you could like, where you could have like a virtual obstacle course and do it on the computer and actually see what it looks like.	B-A
L: Was it right here?	I-A
F: Yeah. Yeah.	B-OO
L: Yay.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah.	I-NSTO
T: Yay	O
<Laughing>	O
L: Yeah we need to figure out how to get it to work.	B-OO
F: Yeah we change, yeah we can change it at this point.	I-OO
L: Oh good.	I-OO
S: Oh yay	I-OO
T: (?) exact question(?) just plough everything	O
S: (?) oh we hit the lever it all fell. It partially worked	B-OO
T: Just think about if this were real life that’s not the way you would get those out of there	O
S: Yeah but if it was real life we wouldn’t be programing a lego cart to do it.	B-OO
T: That’s the idea, think of all the Mars rover you know.	O
F: I know yeah.	B-OO
S: In real life we wouldn’t...	I-OO
F: We wouldn’t have lego bricks	I-OO
S: ...it wouldn’t be this (?).	I-OO
F: If it was real life we could just wash it out in soapy water.	I-OO
S: It wouldn’t even be as big at the lego’s, they’d be tiny.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: We’re not to worry about running over the bacteria.	B-A
L: So what do we do?	B-OO
F: Okay, so right now,	I-OO
L: Right so leave this one for starters.	B-ATO
F: Yes, this one doesn’t work.	I-ATO
L: (We did that).	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
F: Well, right lets	I-OO
L: Mama don’t rain on our parade we kind of got it.	I-OO
F: At least we know how to run the program.	I-OO
T: (?) It was close.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: So yay Pru	I-OO
L: Yay of trial and error, that’s why you’re a teacher.	I-OO
T: Safety third! (?)	O
L: Oh my gosh okay. Alrighty so	B-OO
F: We’re gonna d- run it on (?)	I-OO
L: Wait	I-OO
F: Okay, okay I just.	I-OO
L: Yeah I got it.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: I got it.	I-OO
F: I got it, I got it.	I-OO
L: I got it okay.	I-OO
F: Okay, so that last one we don’t actually need it to go as (?).	B-DO
L: (?)	O
F: Okay.	B-OO
T: Give me the little (gun/gum)	O
S: Hai	B-OO
L: Sarah	I-OO
F: Sarah. (Come on)	I-OO
L: (Yeah it’s close.) Mama you’re not.	I-OO
T: Just ignore me please I’m getting a little (?)	O
L: Okay, sure.	B-OO
F: Okay alright	I-OO
S: I'm gonna do it on (that) draw (?) plan here.	B-A
F: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay so what we’re doing is...	B-A
F: Okay, so we have it going diagonal and then making a ninety degree turn,	B-ATV
S: (This space)	B-A
F: So we need it to make a...	B-DO
L: What if we had it go...	I-DO
S: Starting it from right here, so...	B-A
L: This way three times.	B-ATV
F: This one?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: (?) bacteria. This lever and it, it dumps that direction	B-A
L: And then we had a	B-ATO
S: So	B-OO
L: Second turn a little bit harder.	B-ATO
F: The second turn, this one or this one?	I-ATO
S: It needs to go like this,	I-ATO
L: Yeah that one.	I-ATO
S: This	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
S: (C)	I-OO
F: C. Alright, so like two.	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
S: (Turn) then loops and then go back this way (this way)	B-A
F: I think that we should make it go like two and a half maybe.	B-ATV
S: So this is a route we could take.	B-A
F: Right I think we (?) that one.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: I'm just trying to figure out what we’re doing.	B-A
F: Yeah it's good to physically draw it out.	I-A
S: Are we gonna go for the um other bacteria places as well.	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Well yeah. Er not so far.	B-DO
F: What? What?	B-OO
L: The, it turned like all the way we don’t need it go all the way round.	B-ATO
F: Alright, so just (two)?	B-ATV
F: Yeah. Wait, don’t play yet, okay go. I think that Sarah we go more diagonally.	B-ATO
S: That’s right yeah.	B-OO
F: Lets start it diagonal so we can see	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: And put something in relation to where the bacteria...	B-A
S: Alright. Sarah can we have your tissue or a tissue.	B-OO
F: Here you go.	I-OO
L: Er	I-OO
F: Here. Yeah	I-OO
L: Like here would you say?	B-A
F: Er so this is the square it's more like here.	I-A
L: It's okay. We obviously run into the truck	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And we miss it.	B-A
F: Alright, we don’t need it to go that far, oh wait no. No.	B-DO
L: Wait... No.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: You fool, no!	I-OO
S: Oi, don’t take my catchphrase.	I-OO
L: Well I'm not calling Fiona a fool I'm calling the robot a fool.	I-OO
F: Yes	I-OO
L: What if we went farther on this for here?	B-ATO
F: This one? Which one?	I-ATO
L: Yeah. That.	B-OO
F: This, this (D and C). (Do)	B-ATV
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Oi, stop.	B-NSTO
L: Stop.	I-NSTO
S: (Okay and some bacteria)	B-A
L: Stop (?) stop it, no, oh it's (running) (?) okay.	B-NSTO
S: (Probably) over.	B-A
F: Alright, got to try it again. I think like this is the (?), be more like that (?).	I-A
S: See so...	I-A
F: Really close.	B-NSTO
L: Do you wanna try it?	B-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: Okay so (?).	I-OO
F: (That’s right)	I-OO
F: Okay so it's the Banbury  Cheese underscore one. Oh wait we can (?).	B-QS
L: Okay (right well) you got the (map).	B-OO
S: Uh?	I-OO
L: Did you get a map?	I-OO
S: I'm getting a map (?) later.	I-OO
F: Alright okay	I-OO
L: Cool. Right so...	I-OO
L: Like that?	B-A
F: Yeah, yeah.	B-OO
L: It's gonna run into the trucks so I'm gonna back it up some.	B-A
F: Or we could, we should start it consistently at the same place.	I-A
L: Yeah I shall put a...	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: ...thing at the correct tire.	B-A
F: What, what, what? Okay, no it needs to go further.	B-DO
L: Alright needs to be...	I-DO
F: Or we can start it here.	B-A
L: Yeah, wait... why did they?	B-OO
F: No	I-OO
L: Well they did fall.	B-DO
F: Yay <laughs>	B-OO
S: So it’ll dump this way, round here, down here.	B-A
F: So we’re gonna need it to go...	B-DO
L: So far at the back.	I-DO
F: We’re gonna need it to go like this far, we don’t need it to go as far as it’s going I think, lets not change the distance because we want to change the programing rather than just changing where we start the thing,	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
F: Cos want to be consistent, so it should probably go like to here and then make a ninety degree turn and then go straight.	B-ATV
S: Down (?)	B-A
F: So lets see how far it goes now.  So we only need it to do a smaller turn, we need it to do a smaller turn after that, lets try that first.	B-ATO
L: Yeah	B-OO
S: Oh are we gonna get that bacteria base by the fish as well.	B-A
F: What? I don’t think we’re gonna do, lets focus on this thing right now, because I don’t think we need to...oh you mean how are we gonna get around the fish?	I-A
S: Yes.	B-OO
F: Ploughing, I don’t know.	B-A
L: And we could probably ignore that one for now.	B-OO
S: I know how we’re gonna get (?) the way back	B-A
L: Yeah we could...	B-OO
F: Alright, wait plug it in.	B-QR
L: Wait not yet.	B-OO
F: Not yet.	I-OO
L: Which ones do you have marked out? Sarah.	I-OO
S: Um what? Which ones do I have?	I-OO
L: Yeah	I-OO
S: Okay so I have the ones that are far back (?)exact measurement but, this is how we do it, so we exit, so...	B-A
M: Lunch in five minutes.	O
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: ...so we leave the base here like after we shovel these ones in and reset it to go here then we move past here towards the (cooling) plant (?) stop right in front of it, move up, circle round it and then we hit the one at the far left corner first, we move around after we hit the lever on that one we move round the back, go around hit this one’s lever...	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: ...then we move around one more time, collect the thing, how did I do this, then we go down here and be caught.	B-A
F: Alright, okay, do you think it's realistic to be able to think that we’re gonna scoop up all of them because the points only count for the scooped up ones?	I-A
S: No I don’t think that the...	B-OO
F: The point, the points only count for the scooped up ones if all them are scooped into the base.	B-A
S: Okay (?).	B-OO
F: It's here on the bacteria one, twelve points each if no bacteria is touching the mat outside the base.  So that means we could either scoop in like a couple of them and get all the bacteria in or, or knock over all of them and just go back to the base.	B-A
S: Well I don’t think there’s a way we can get all them because they scatter really easily.	I-A
F: It's weird it does like, oh did you change this one? Maybe we could it one point two.	B-ATV
F: Wait, what did it do?	B-DO
I think something was... Yeah that’s a good turn.	I-DO
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright,	I-OO
L: Lets save that then.	I-OO
F: (?)	I-OO
L: Did you save this?	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay, so it's saved as Banbury cheese underscore bacteria.	I-OO
L: Sarah we’re gonna go and check it if you want to come or keep on working on your (map).	I-OO
S: Um I’ll come.	I-OO
F: You can move any of this stuff away I think.	I-OO
L: Yeah, this is where we were started.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: And they was like on the top.	B-A
F: And this is on the bottom.	I-A
L: You ready?	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Perfect.	B-NSTO
F: Yeah, then how do we get it out> oh we can have it, how do we have it go back.	B-A
S: Okay so you guys have this one figured out.	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: But for the ones down here...	B-A
L: We still need to figure out how to get it out (though).	I-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: Okay we attach the thing on the base on the back...	B-D
F: We’re not gonna worry about the (bulldozers)...	I-D
L: But I think that’s actually a really good idea.	B-A
F: I know it is a gre-, it is a good idea but if we made it, it would have to be consistent enough to get everything back or else the points don’t count at all.	I-A
L: Well it wouldn’t have to get it back. Would we?	I-A
F: Oh so that it would just move it out of the way so the thing could move.	I-A
L: Yeah so a bit like the plough would like just get through there.	B-D
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: So that would be like...	B-A
F: Cool.	B-OO
L: ...yo we’re out yeah okay.	B-A
F: Okay that’s great.	B-OO
S: Okay, so (about) the ones down here, so you leave here, you go right here, you go to exit this, go right here and go you circle round that way (?) go down here almost straight (?).	B-A
L: Okay	B-OO
S: (?) back to base	B-A
F: Cool let’s...	B-OO
L: (?)...one more time there?	I-OO
F: Yeah so this would be there, and that’s right there.	B-A
L: (?) Yeah okay.	B-OO
S: Did it just run over it?	B-DO
F: Yes it did.	B-OO
L: Okay lets try that again.	I-OO
F: And that no, it needs to be very specific.	B-A
L: Did not go to the right spot.	B-DO
F: It needs to be very specific about it, no we can’t have any...yeah.	B-A
L: Hmm no it's been going there.	B-DO
F: It's been going there but it's not consit- they are not lining it up consistently enough.	B-A
L: It just runs it over.	B-DO
F: It's tipping the, the thing is...maybe it’s just...	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
L: (?) Yeah okay.	I-OO
F: Why isn’t it doing it, that’s weird.	B-NSTO
LUNCH BREAK	O
S: Somebody’s crabby.	B-OO
L: Me?	I-OO
S: Yes.	I-OO
L: No I just want to get back to work.	I-OO
S: Okay so here’s a battle plan for our next target.	I-OO
F: Alright do you want to start build, Sarah do you want to start building a plough thing that can go on the back?	I-OO
S: Okay how are we gonna do that?	B-D
F: I don’t know lets look at the back of it, are there any...	I-D
L: Okay, well why don’t...	B-OO
F: ...places where things can go in.	B-D
L: This.	B-OO
L: Why don’t Sarah, why don’t you build like a prototype sort of thing and (?).	B-D
S: But I don’t know how to build a plough.	I-D
L: Oh there we go okay.	B-OO
S: I'm completely useless at Legos.	I-OO
F: You’ll be able to figure it out there’s some easy stuff to do.	I-OO
L: Which (Banbury cheese) (?).	B-QS
S: Figure it out seriously.	B-OO
F: Banberry Cheese underscore	B-QS
S: Okay.	B-OO
L: Okay lets go try it out, lets like try it (?).	I-OO
S: Let me see if they have plough instructions.	B-D
L: Plough construction.	I-D
S: Plough instructions.	I-D
L: I doubt that they do but...	B-OO
S: Don’t ruin my thunder here.	I-OO
F: Can we use that for a second? Thanks.	I-OO
L: Okay we had it, so we had it here right.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Oh my god.	B-NSTO
F: Why is it running it over?	B-DO
S: I don’t know.	B-OO
F: Okay so this one’s like.	B-A
L: Okay give it a try again.	B-OO
S: What the?	B-NSTO
L: (Let me try)	B-OO
S: I think the like lever’s broken...	B-A
L: I think (?)...	B-OO
S: ...it shouldn’t be so low.	B-A
L: Let me just move it back a little bit. Don’t worry I get it higher.	I-A
S: I'm just trying to get it to not run over the lever.	B-DO
