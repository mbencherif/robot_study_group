L: Yes.	B-OO
T: Oh.	O
L: Ok it needs to go further.	B-DO
S: Okay.	B-OO
F: Just a tiny bit though.	B-DO
S: Put it back to it's orig-	B-A
L: Hold on.	B-OO
S: Or we could just like take that of, or we could just like scooch that down so it only catching on that thing, so...	B-A
L: Yeah	B-OO
T: Well if it kept going...	O
F: L- Lyn	O
L: Yeah it needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Lets start it here I think we had it scooched in a little bit too, so lets just start it at the edge this time.	B-A
S: Remember when it caught on the edge of the frame.	B-DO
L: Yeah we switched it since, that’s why.	I-DO
S: Well you could just remove those extra little bits that it caught on.	B-D
F: Oh whoops, what did it do?	B-NSTO
L: Huh	I-NSTO
F: That was weird.	I-NSTO
L: Okay try placing it here.	B-A
S: I think we could just remove those guys um and put it back to the place when it was catching on the frame, because those guys were really what got caught.	B-D
S: It needs to go further.	B-DO
F: Why’s it suddenly, that’s weird.	B-NSTO
L: Where are you placing (?)	B-A
S: I think you have it closer right here.	I-A
T: (Move it towards the edge)	O
F: Move it towards the edge maybe.	B-A
T: Worth a try.	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay it just needs to go further.	B-DO
T: That’s brilliant.	B-OO
F: Yay it’s working.	B-NSTO
T: And you had the wheel right on...	O
F: On, the black yeah. Yay.	B-A
L: Okay so one more...	B-OO
S: Wait wait wait Lyn I need to see something come back.	I-OO
L: Because what?	I-OO
S: (?) how far will it need to go past here? Because it needs a loop round this.	B-DO
L: I think it needs two more.	B-ATV
L: Yeah I was looking at that before, I think it needs two more.	I-ATV
F: Sarah you should do some of the programing because I feel like it's me and Lyn doing a lot of it and you’re getting bored so.	B-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
F: You should probably do some stuff.	I-OO
S: How does half this stuff work.	I-OO
L: Okay so (?)	B-OO
F: I’ll sit here I guess	I-OO
F: Alright so you probably wanna drag, see how the revolutions is set to two there,	B-ATV
S: Hm mm	B-OO
F: Double click on that?	I-OO
L: No	I-OO
F: No that’s the wrong clicker. Yeah.	I-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
F: And then...	I-OO
L: We get (?)	I-OO
F: ...delete it, it's the backspace on here.	B-QS
L: Wait, no make it four or three point five.	B-ATV
S: Is that a three point five?	I-ATV
F: Yeah.	B-OO
S: And then next one?	I-OO
F: Yeah sure.	I-OO
L: Then the next one is a turn.	B-ATO
F: So you only want to do that one.	I-ATO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: (?) (to load?)	I-OO
L: Yeah. And you want it to be a C.	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Port C. And um one is correct, so you just leave that, okay and then the next one is two.	B-ATV
F: And move tank yeah.	B-ATO
L: Yeah move tank to two.	B-ATV
F: Make sure you’re...	B-OO
L: Yeah.	I-OO
S: (?)	I-OO
L: (?). Yeah. Yeah, watch where the one is.	B-ATV
S: What do you want me to do?	B-OO
L: Two.	B-ATV
S: Any good?	B-OO
L: Huh, huh	I-OO
S: Right the next one,	I-OO
F: You wanna try it? Lets make it, lets do a test.	I-OO
L: Okay. So, so that (?).	I-OO
F: ... is the download button.	B-QS
L: Oh yeah.	B-OO
F: Oh it's not plugged in.	B-QS
L: No it is, yeah. Just click it together, you don’t keep it down just. Yeah. Okay. Right.	I-QS
F: Alright so we need to make sure that this is...	B-OO
L: Yeah, well (?).	I-OO
F: (Over) there	I-OO
L: Let me try (?)	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Okay yeah.	I-OO
F: Oh...	I-OO
L: No it was at different spot, it wa- I think it was further back.	B-A
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Or more to the side of something.	B-A
T: (?) (could count on the little mark).	O
F: Yeah I'm setting it back to one tick mark kind of and (?) the side.  It's not gonna work.	B-A
L: Okay	B-NSTO
S: It was working before though.	I-NSTO
F: Yeah maybe just need to make it go a little further before it turns, I think that might just be the solution	B-DO
S: Well it, it worked before so where were you do you think?	B-NSTO
L: Maybe it was like more kind of like...	B-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
L: No.	I-OO
F: No	I-OO
S: What happened it isn’t going as far as it was?	B-DO
F: Alright, we can also just change the programming instead of figuring out where exactly the (?).	B-A
S: Yeah lets have it go farther.	B-DO
S: Wait, wait, wait you need to see which one it was again.	I-DO
F: I know which one it was.	I-DO
L: It was	B-OO
F: Yeah, we know, so...yeah.	I-OO
S: Agh (sorry)	I-OO
F: It was on,	I-OO
L: Wait	I-OO
F: Okay so (?).	I-OO
S: Which one was it?	I-OO
F: It was okay, don’t sh...okay so it went forward and then it turned then it went forward and then it...not that one I think it's that one.	B-ATO
L: (That) one	I-ATO
S: Which one?	I-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
F: This one?	I-ATO
S: This one? Which one?	I-ATO
L: Yeah the one that you’re just on yes, yes.	I-ATO
S: So...	B-OO
L: Three...	B-ATV
F: Click yeah/ No don’t make it two make it like two point seven five.	I-ATV
L: Okay and now just save it.	B-QS
F: Yeah, yeah no, no	B-OO
L: No	I-OO
F: You don’t need to do that.	I-OO
L: As in like download it.	I-OO
F: Download it.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: You okay sleepy?	I-OO
S: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay lets go and try.	I-OO
S: (?).	I-OO
F: (?) was in that gallery walk and (?) gallery walk,	I-OO
S: I'm pretty sure it (?) gallery walk.	I-OO
L: Elsie, Matthew, Marcus and Ian I think were all there.	I-OO
S: Really anybody outside you and Else ever invites me anywhere. (?) school	I-OO
F: Alright I'm setting it back to the second one because I feel like...	B-A
S: Lyn, really anybody besides you and Elsie ever invites me an- outside our school ever invites me anywhere.	B-OO
F: Oh, whoops alright. Can you grab it so that its (?).	B-NSTO
S: What went wrong?	I-NSTO
F: I’ll just set it further back or further.	B-DO
S: Are you sure it was that turn and not the other one?	I-DO
L: Yeah I think it was wrong on.	I-DO
F: Hey, taking more than one. What?	B-OO
L: No.	I-OO
T: (?) if it makes you feel better	O
L: Lets, no lets see this.	B-OO
T: Alright never mind	O
L: Yeah okay (?) ditch this from two point five back to, two point...	B-ATV
F: You’re clicking the wrong button.	B-QS
S: Wait, so what?	B-OO
F: What Lyn I don’t think she understands you.	I-OO
L: You switch it to two point, two five. Two five.	B-ATV
F: Put a two there. Okay.	I-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
S: I think it was one	B-ATV
L: This one I think should be two, I think that’s where I went wrong.	I-ATV
L: Okay, did you save it?	B-OO
F: Yeah. Click it,	B-QS
L: You just (?) you go.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: I did click it though.	B-QS
L: Yeah you just don’t hold it down the whole time.	I-QS
S: I didn’t hold it down.	I-QS
F: Alright.	B-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Okay. We can change the starting position a little bit.	B-A
S: Two point twen- Or not. No it needs to be further ahead.	B-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Further ahead.	B-A
L: Than it was at the start so like, whatever	I-A
F: Oh. Oh.	B-NSTO
S: Just remove those things on the edges and you’ll be fine.	B-D
F: Yeah, do we need to have those?	I-D
S: No we don’t.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
S: They’re just useless little things that are just sitting there.	B-D
L: (?) whatever.	B-OO
F: Okay. Alright.	I-OO
L: You started the wrong spot I think.	B-A
F: Yeah, okay. Why is it doing that?	B-NSTO
L: I think you need it more forward, I think it just (?).	B-A
S: Are you sure it's straight?	I-A
F: It's mostly straight.	I-A
L: Lets switch the distance here.	B-DO
F: (?) tiny a bit shorter, because two point five can just be like two point four.	B-ATV
S: Two point four?	I-ATV
L: No, no.	B-OO
S: This one or which one?	I-OO
T: You guys take a fresh air break (?).	O
S: Oh fresh air (?)	B-OO
T: (?) fresh air (?	O
L: Yeah make this one point...	B-ATV
F: Nine?	I-ATV
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Alright. And we need to plug it in.	B-QS
L: Yeah	B-OO
F: Yeah yeah.	I-OO
L: And save.	B-QS
F: Oh wait is it plugged in	I-QS
L: Yeah that’s right.	B-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: Sarah.	I-OO
F: Yeah. Just lightly tap it.	B-QS
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Where’s the other one of these? Oh Lyn we should probably put these back to where we got them from so we don’t lose them.	B-D
L: Why didn’t you just put them up next to the computer incase we need them?	I-D
<General classroom noise>	O
F: Ha ha ha ha	B-OO
L: Okay lets go.	I-OO
F: Oh yeah. Okay Banbury Cheese, Banbury Two. What?	B-QS
S: It's too far.	B-DO
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Lets just (?).	I-OO
S: So we shrunk it and yet it went further.	B-DO
L: Well that won’t increase like that wont help.	I-DO
F: It should.	B-OO
L: No because it's the turn that’s the problem I think.	B-DO
F: Yeah.	B-OO
L: Okay, here.	I-OO
S: Change positions again?	B-A
L: Yeah, no like here I think one more time.	B-A
F: Here.	B-A
L: Yes.	B-OO
S: You’re having a second...	I-OO
F: Don’t worry.	I-OO
GS1: But I want to suggest something.	O
F: Sure.	B-OO
GS1: What are you trying to get?	O
F: We’re, we’re not there but we’re trying to, right now we’re basically just trying to make this turn work.	B-OO
GS1: You keep running it over here you should maybe like stop this way...	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
GS1: ...so then you can turn (?).	O
S: That’s what we, that’s we’re trying to do but the...	B-OO
F: That’s what we’re	I-OO
S: ...but the	I-OO
F: Yeah	I-OO
S: Um but the distance is off (?) though	B-DO
F: Yeah the distance is off	I-DO
L: We did.	B-OO
F: We did	I-OO
L: It just needs to be (?) a little more I think.	B-DO
S: So one point eight instead?	B-ATV
L: Well maybe it’s just	B-OO
L: Yay, wait wrong direction.It could turn back there but we knocked these off.	B-A
S: Remember that spot Fiona.	I-A
F: Alright you guys can use it now.	B-OO
S: Remember that spot.	B-A
F: Yeah. Yeah it worked you just need to like line it up a certain way.	I-A
S: Fiona we should also have (?), why don’t after we switch the distance we also check on, on Banbury one.	B-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
S: Okay.	I-OO
L: You gonna switch distance Sarah or do you want Fiona to do it? Sarah.	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
L: Since you’ve been doing the distance (?) are you gonna do it? Or do you want us to do it.	I-OO
S: I’ll do it.	I-OO
F: Alright cool. Ha ha ha	I-OO
S: You know you can’t make weird noises like I can. (growling noise).	I-OO
L: (noise)	I-OO
S: Not like that.	I-OO
L: Try seven. Okay and save it.	B-ATV
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright.	I-OO
L: Alright.	I-OO
F: Do you want to stay here Sarah if you’re feeling tired?	I-OO
S: No I'm good.	I-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: I'm good.	I-OO
L: What’s wrong Sarah?	I-OO
S: Nothing.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
F: Just sleepy. Do you want to try the first one also?	I-OO
L: Yeah why not. Okay.	I-OO
F: We’re starting it like...	B-A
S: Your mom’s trying to convince us to get fresh air.	B-OO
F: Yeah wait...	I-OO
S: Banbury one.	I-OO
F: I lost something,	I-OO
L: What did  you lose?	I-OO
F: Project, okay Banbury Cheese, okay there we go, oh whoops I forgot that it goes backwards.	B-QS
S: (?) on your arm Fiona, okay.	B-OO
F: Okay	I-OO
L: Okay. What? Ha ha ha Okay	B-NSTO
F: Oh yeah we had it further back, you should remember that.	B-A
S: Now you mention it.	B-OO
H: You should get extra points for that for flipping it over.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
F: Yeah. Ten points.	I-OO
L: Okay. These are all falling out now.	I-OO
F: Okay.	I-OO
L: God Fiona.	I-OO
F: I think we had it like that.	B-A
L: What?	B-OO
F: What?	I-OO
S: What?	I-OO
L: No.	I-OO
S: No...you’re meant to go and knock it over you silly little thing.	B-D
F: Okay. Sarah don’t think shouting at it is gonna do it any good.	B-OO
S: It works for diff- other things, (?) it works for me.	I-OO
F: Perfect.	B-NSTO
S: Okay so she claims.	B-OO
F: Shut up Sarah. No.	I-OO
S: Sarah has lots of  good points of view, she also has a handful of bacteria. Don’t mess with her.	I-OO
L: Sarah can the handful of bacteria go in?	I-OO
S: You left one.	I-OO
L: Okay.	I-OO
S: Don’t worry we get (?) in a minute.	I-OO
F: Okay. Lets line up this with the (?).	B-A
L: Yes, maybe.	B-NSTO
S: Yes, yes, yes...	I-NSTO
F: Yay.	B-OO
L: Okay good.	I-OO
F: Okay it works.	B-NSTO
L: Alright.	B-OO
S: Okay it's all yours.	I-OO
F: Just need to have it lined up.	B-A
GS1: I have a question.	O
S: yeah	B-OO
GS1: So you guys getting those that one and that one and this one.	O
S: Yes.	B-OO
L: Yeah hopefully	I-OO
F: We’re having it as two separate things though. So	I-OO
S: Yeah so...	I-OO
F: So  that if it messes up the...	I-OO
GS2: (?).	O
F: Yeah.	B-OO
GS2: Make it separate (?) you know what I mean.	O
F: Alright.	B-OO
GS2: Make it a separate mission.	O
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Do you mind if we test out er one thing really quick?	I-OO
GS2: No that’s fine.	O
F: Thanks, er right where was it lined up?	B-A
L: It was lined up that way	I-A
F: It was like...?  It was this way, I think that it was on the first one.	I-A
L: Yeah there we go.	B-NSTO
F: Okay. Oh no.	I-NSTO
S: I think it was further forwards.	B-A
L: Okay.	B-OO
F: Alright, this way.	B-A
S: I'm sorry we’re taking so long.	B-OO
GS1: It's alright.	O
S: No, no further forward.	B-A
F: Forward?	I-A
S: Yeah because it (?)	I-A
F: It has to be (?) it has to be inside of the thing though.	I-A
L: I think Fiona it was over that way more. Yeah there we go.	I-A
T: (If you figure it out) you should draw a little diagram of where it should be.	O
L: Yeah.	B-OO
S: I already did so...	I-OO
F: No you	I-OO
S: (?) thing	I-OO
F: Yeah.	I-OO
L: Okay, let’s.	I-OO
F: Yes that’s what I was thinking	I-OO
L: Lets let them go.	I-OO
F: Yes.	I-OO
S: Yeah	I-OO
F: Sorry we took a long time. God damn it the ball was everywhere now.	I-OO
S: Where’s my map go?	I-OO
F: Okay we should draw on the back of it where it should be for the start again. So, I’m number one  number two...	B-A
S: Notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch, notch.	I-A
F: Okay we don’t need them (?).	B-OO
S: I'm making more notch’s shoosh.	B-A
F: Artistic licence.	B-OO
L: Okay Fiona, wanna start programing the rest of two, Sarah you’re working on the notch map.	I-OO
